<p>I have been working the last couple of weeks on a business plan idea for a company tenatively called eVentor: <blockquote>eVentor is a unique event marketplace that brings together event producers and attendees to dynamically create, staff, and people events of all types--from concerts and performances to reunions and seminars. It does so by using the power of smart contracts to arrive at joint consensus and by acting as a single clearing house for the entire process of event creation, from earliest negotiations to final registration.</blockquote>The key thought with eVentor is similar to that of eBay -- eBay has reduced the barriers of entry for a small business such that people can now do new ventures starting entirely from their own home. It has done this by creating a huge marketplace and by acting as a trusted third party that individuals and small companies can fully particpate in. This has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new "micro-businesses", some of which of which have grown substatially in size.</p>
<p>What eVentor wants to do is similar -- lower the barriers of entry for small events, whether a seminar, a concert, a dinner meeting, a family reunion, etc., lowering it to such a level that people who could not afford to manage the complexity of small events before can do so now do so in order to make new "micro-businesses".</p>
<p>At this point the idea has just myself behind it -- call it an "entrepreneur-in-residence exercise". I will be running this business plan by a few possible contributors and/or partners in the next few weeks, as well as investigating partnerships with some of the new social software companies that don't have a business model. Ultimatately I plan to present this business plan to a couple of Angel Investors and VCs in January.</p>
