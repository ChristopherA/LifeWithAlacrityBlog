<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Opening Scene of Darmok, STtNG S05E02" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c img-responsive" src="/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Opening Scene of Darmok, STtNG S05E02" /></a>If you consider yourself a futurist or an agent of change, you should read this article from The Atlantic <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/">&quot;Shaka, When the Walls Fall&quot;</a>. Yes, it uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok">Star Trek episode</a> as an allegory, it is a bit confusing and has a lot of complexity and depth, but it is a good introduction to a topic I care about — <em><strong>Deep Context Shared Languages</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I consider one of my missions in life to be to &quot;create tools that allow people to communicate about complexity&quot;. There are many problems to address and many possible solutions to those problems. My <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/InfiniteCanvasSuite/">Infinite Canvas Suite</a>&#0160;</span>app tries&#0160;to address problems of linearity. Another way to manage complexity is facilitating the creation and learning of <a href="/2009/09/creating-shared-language-and-shared-artiifacts.html">Shared Languages</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of what Shared Language is is tribal — it has an elemental power to help a group form. But what a shared language also does is allow a group to take shortcuts. For instance, with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GroupWorksDeck/"><span class="s2">Group Works Deck</span></a> Pattern Language, I can say the phrase &quot;Viewpoint Shift&quot; and practitioners know that I mean <em>&quot;Step from your usual perspective into another in order to better understand someone, shift energy, reframe meanings, open up new ideas, or simply see a situation with new eyes.&quot;</em> But they also know more than that — they can connect that concept to their own experience of doing this practice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first time I was introduced to this concept was by expert facilitator and futurist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RMattTaylor"><span class="s2">Matt Taylor</span></a>, who has in his communities a Shared Language concept called a &quot;Glass Bead Game&quot;, which is from a story by Herman Hess. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game">Wikipedia cites it</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&quot;The Glass Bead Game is &quot;a kind of synthesis of human learning&quot; in which themes, such as a musical phrase or a philosophical thought, are stated. As the Game progresses, associations between the themes become deeper and more varied.&quot;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c img-responsive" src="/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-75wi" style="width: 60px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design" /></a>When you know the shared language of Matt&#39;s community, you can express concisely &quot;In the SOLUTION BOX I am at INSIGHT, PHILOSOPHY and SCHEMATIC DESIGN.&quot; Which means, in other words, <em>&quot;I have a mature idea that I feel is a synthesis of all the challenges inherent in the project, I can talk about it with some clarity and express it as a visual solution. I have done a lot of work yet I do not have a buildable design.&quot;</em> Someone familiar with the language can then respond in kind, rather than coming from a different perspective in the solution box and think that I have built something that is ready for production.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes hash tags are a more contemporary expression that there may exist a Deep Context. For instance, just saying <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/glassbeadgame?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">GlassBeadGame</span></a> is a challenge for someone to respond in kind with a model of their own. Hash tags like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/intrapreneuring?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">Intrapreneuring</span></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freedomtofail?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">FreedomToFail</span></a> also have&#0160;Deep Contexts with different communities. If someone says to me <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cynefin?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">Cynefin</span></a> I know that we share an understanding with me about the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework">&quot;complicated&quot; vs &quot;complex&quot; </a>and how to work with each.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what makes for great deep context shared languages? I don&#39;t know, but this article touches on it. It is more than just metaphor, more than allegory, more than meme. But if we can figure out how to create and teach it, it may be a powerful tool for communicating about complexity.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">KEYQUOTE: &quot;Here we might distinguish between the invocation of a particular logic and the simulation of a creature, thing, or idea by replicating its image. The simulation of life in art often concerns the reproduction of surfaces: in painting, the appearance of form, perspective, or the rendition of light; in literature the appearance of character or event; in photography and cinema the rendition of the world as it appears through optical element and upon emulsion or sensor; in theater the rendition of the behavior of a character or situation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While all these examples “simulate” to various extents, they do so by a process of rendering. For example, the writer might simulate a convincing verbal intercourse by producing a credibility that allows the reader to take it as reality. Likewise, the actor might render a visible behavior or intonation that is suggestive of a particular emotion, event, or history that the theatrical or cinematic viewer takes as evidence for some unseen motivation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A logic is also a behavior, but it is a behavior unlike the behavior of the literary or theatrical character, for whom behaving involves producing an outward sign of some deeper but abstracted motivation, understanding, or desire. By contrast logics are pure behaviors. They are abstract and intangible and yet also real.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we pretend that “Shaka, when the walls fell” is a signifier, then its signified&#0160;not by the fictional mythological character Shaka, nor the myth that contains whatever calamity caused the walls to fall, but the logic by which the situation itself came about. Tamarian language isn’t really language at all, but machinery.&quot;</span></p>
