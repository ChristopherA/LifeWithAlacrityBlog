<p>I decided after years of reading blogs that it was time to start blogging.</p>
<p>Why Blogger? I wanted an easy web interface, but also I wanted it hosted on my site (which is <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> based). A couple of blog tools offer this. I wanted something really simple and I didn't want to host my own tools (keeping my own TWiki's up-to-date has been a pain) so I wanted the tools hosted elsewere. I also required that the remote tools used a secure connection to my server -- Blogger uses SFTP.</p>
<p>But the clincher was the new <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google Toolbar</a>.</p>
<p>My only SNAFU so far is that I've got my new <a href="http://twiki.alacritymanagement.com/bin/view/Kitchen">Kitchen TWiki</a> working to send and receive RSS, however, the signup for <a href="http://pro.blogger.com/">Blogger Pro</a> has the note "Blogger Pro ordering is currently offline while we retool. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please check back next week."</p>
