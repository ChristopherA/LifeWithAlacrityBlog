A MP3 podcast of that talk is now available at <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1072.html">IT Conversations</a><a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1072.html">&nbsp;</a> or can be <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/audio/download/itconversations-1072.mp3">downloaded here (10mb)</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to follow along, here is a pdf copy of my <a href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/MeshForum_2006_Dunbar_Number.pdf">presentation sides (10mb)</a>.</p>
<p>Biggest addition to what I've written about before is some discussion about different kinds of social software and what what size groups they seem to be appropriate for.</p>
