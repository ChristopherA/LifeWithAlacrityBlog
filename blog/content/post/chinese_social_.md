<p><a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/6674682935746669/">The Social Software Weblog</a> discusses <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=61083">DragonVenture Invests in Social Networking Platform in China</a>:<blockquote>"If you think Friendster was slow with four million members imagine if a tens of millions, or hundreds of millions, of the two billion people in China join eFriendsnet.com! Why hasn't Friendster or Tribe.net launched international sites?!"</blockquote>This reminds of a quote I heard this last weekend from Tom Melcher, former CNET exec, and who has <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,60960,00.html">recently left</a> <a href="http://www.there.com">There</a> to live and work in China:<blockquote>There are now more people in China on the Internet then there are members of the Chinese Communist Party.</blockquote>I wonder how well explicit social networks will take off in China, given a history of repression and recent censoring of the Internet. I could see it easily becoming a tool that could be abused by their government.</p>
