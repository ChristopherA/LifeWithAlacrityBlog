<p>This blog has been quiet lately as I've been doing a lot of work in the last year on the iPhone. I've been speaking at conferences like eComm 2008 (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eComm2008/christopher-allens-presentation-at-ecomm-2008">presentation</a>, <a href="http://blogs.nmscommunications.com/communications/2008/05/heres-the-compl.html">video from panel</a>), writing an book on the iPhone with my co-author Shannon Appelcline called <a href="http://www.manning.com/callen">iPhone in Action: Introduction to Web and SDK Development</a> (first <a href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/callen/callen_meapch1-2.pdf">two chapters</a> free</a>), and I am one of the organizers for the upcoming <a href="http://www.iPhoneDevCamp.org">iPhoneDevCamp 2</a>, a MacHack style conference on August 1st-3rd, and I am working on some social software apps for the iPhone.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to post too many of these off posts on this blog, as I like the length, quality and high-signal-to-noise ratio of the posts that I've written for this blog. I do plan to continue to offer more social software and social media posts, including followups to my <a href="/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">Collective Choice</a> articles, as well as updates on my popular <a href="/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> posts. But I don't want to spam my readers here with notes on iPhone Apps, my thoughts on movies, circuses, the odd conferences I speak at, etc.</p>

So far I have posted:<p><ul ><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/max-9-pages-thu.html">Max 9 pages, thus Max 144 Apps on iPhone OS 2.0</a></li><li ><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/first-look-at-a.html">First Look at AirMe App for iPhone</a></li><li ><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/trying-out-type.html">Trying Out TypePad's Blog It Web App</a></li><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/iphone-typepa-1.html">iPhone TypePad App Second Pass</a></li><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/iphone-typepad.html">iPhone TypePad App First Look</a></li><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/ephemera-blog.html">Ephemera Blog</a></li></ul></p></p>
