<p>I have been working on some code for experimenting with some of my ideas regarding the future of wiki's, at <a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net">EditThisPagePHP</a> which is hosted at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.</p>
<p>At this point it is just a trivial application -- it just lets you edit remotely a single page. I'm trying to slowly add in elegant features without compromising on this projects essential simplicity. Longer term goals are focused around trying to figure out better solutions for the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RefactoringWikiPages">RefactoringWiki Problem</a>, which might include such future features as proposals, voting, different commenting techniques, different versioning, etc. There is no specific commercial goal with this project, it is open source.</p>
