<p>I've been working today on understand the <a href="http://www.designmatrix.com/pl/index.html">Design Pattern Language</a> behind the Wiki concept. I've been making some postings at the Meatball Wiki site on this topic. These are the new topics that I have finished today.</p>
<p><li><a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CategoryWikiDesignPatterns">Category of Wiki Design Patterns</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CheapAndEasyCollaboration">Pattern: Cheap and Easy Collaboration</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SimpleTextFormatting">Pattern: Simple Text Formatting</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CharacterFormattingRules">Pattern: Character Formatting Rules</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ParagraphFormattingRules">Pattern: Paragraph Formatting Rules</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiDesignPatternsMetaCommentary">Wiki Design Patterns Meta Commentary</a></li></p>
<p>I've also been doing a survey of the features of various versions of Wiki that have evolved over the years, and have started posting some of them at the bottom of the pattern documents.</p>
<p>More to come...</p>
