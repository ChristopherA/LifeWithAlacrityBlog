<p>These are the initial required readings for the first two weeks of my <a href="http://www.bgi.edu/changing-business/social-web-for-social-change/" target="_self">Using the Social Web for Social Change</a> class (hashtag #SW4SX) that I teach in the <a href="http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/hybrid-mba/" target="_self">MBA in Sustainable Systems</a>&#0160;program at <a href="http://www.bgi.edu" target="_self">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this portion of the class is to&#0160;cover an introduction and overview of the landscape of the Social Web, establish among the students the beginning of a shared language about the medium, and introduce a process toward a collaborative culture that we will use for the rest of the course. Students are also kicking off their Beat blogs on sustainability topics, with the goal of helping them move toward having an authentic online voice.</p>
<p><strong>TOPIC: New Ways of Learning</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>When I designed this class four years ago, I was inspired by Michael Wesch&#39;s class at Kansas State University. This is a shared artifact created by his class that I use to set the stage for my own students.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>TOPIC: Shared Language</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language. They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience.</em><br /></strong></p>

<li>KEYQUOTE: “Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something…However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact…It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: &quot;Is this what you mean when…&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Why don&#39;t people just say what they mean? The reason is that conversational partners are not modems downloading information into each other&#39;s brains. People are very, very touchy about their relationships. Whenever you speak to someone, you are presuming the two of you have a certain degree of familiarity--which your words might alter. So every sentence has to do two things at once: convey a message and continue to negotiate that relationship.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Shared Language is a prerequisite to collaboration. Without Shared Language, we can’t collaborate. It’s as simple as that. When a group tries to collaborate without having Shared Language, the group will try to create it, whether it’s aware of it or not. This creation process is often frustrating and painful, and as a result, people sometimes try to skip this step or belittle the process. This is a problem. You can’t skip this step.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;The big trend I&#39;m seeing in the future of communications is actually using the social network to share, to be more productive in the work environment, and to do more expression, organizing, creativity, in social and civic context. We&#39;re just in the early stages of the enabling technology to make that happen, how to make that happen technically, and how to make it happen socially so that we can use our social networks and use our groups as a foundation for doing really interesting, productive, and creative things.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;The term &#39;social software&#39;, which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush&#39;s ideas about &#39;memex&#39; in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. By examining the many terms used to describe today&#39;s &#39;social software&#39; we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how there exists a very real life cycle concerning the use of technical terminology.&quot;</li>

<li>QUOTE: &quot;Social media has become an integral part of modern society.&#0160;There are general social networks with user bases larger than the population of most countries. There are niche sites for virtually every special interest out there. There are sites to share photos, videos, status updates, sites for meeting new people and sites to connect with old friends. It seems there are social solutions to just about every need. In this article, we’ll review the history and evolution of social media from its humble beginnings to the present day.&quot;</li>

<li>ABSTRACT: &quot;How much information is really being collected about you? How is it being used? And could it fall into the wrong hands?&#0160;To find out, we queried Facebook and interviewed some two dozen others, including security experts, privacy lawyers, app developers, and victims of security and privacy abuse. We dug into private, academic, and government research, as well as Facebook’s labyrinthian policies and controls. And we surveyed 2,002 online households, including 1,340 that are active on Facebook, for our annual State of the Net report. We then projected those data to estimate national totals.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;It is easy to become unsettled by privacy-eroding aspects of awareness tools. But there is another — quite different — result of all this incessant updating: a culture of people who know much more about themselves. Many of the avid Twitterers, Flickrers and Facebook users I interviewed described an unexpected side-effect of constant self-disclosure. The act of stopping several times a day to observe what you’re feeling or thinking can become, after weeks and weeks, a sort of philosophical act. It’s like the Greek dictum to “know thyself,” or the therapeutic concept of mindfulness. (Indeed, the question that floats eternally at the top of Twitter’s Web site — “What are you doing?” — can come to seem existentially freighted. What are you doing?) Having an audience can make the self-reflection even more acute, since, as my interviewees noted, they’re trying to describe their activities in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting to others: the status update as a literary form.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYPOINTS: &quot;Don&#39;t launch until the blog is properly setup. Pick a topic and stick with it. Be consistent. Don&#39;t leave your readers stranded. Get to the point. Spice it up. Don&#39;t expect the world.&quot;</li>

<li>VanFossen, Lorelle &quot;Are You Really Writing For Your Blog Audience?&quot; The Blog Herald, 2007-05-04

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Think about how the trendy, jargon, national, and regional references you use in your blog may be misunderstood or even confuse your blog readers. It’s critical for bloggers to be “understood”, so take time to look at what you write and how your writing may create a disconnect with your readers.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;One thing we should keep in mind when writing here or in any online forum is that we are writing not only for the present, but for the future. Our words may well be read many times, even far into the future. They are recorded in public and private archives and will be available indefinitely. Given the likely increase in future levels of intelligence and attention, it may even turn out that more eyes see our writings in the far future than in the near present.&quot;</li>
