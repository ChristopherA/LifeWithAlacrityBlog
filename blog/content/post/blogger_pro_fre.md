<p>I have been hesitating on committing to <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> because ever time I check into availability of Blogger Pro, it was not available. Apparently now <a href="http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/pro_email.pyra">Blogger Pro is Free</a>.</p>
<p>My remaining concern is that the <a href="http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/announcement.pyra">new feature list</a> for Blogger Pro does not mention RSS syndication at all, nor does it mention if it will be available in the future. There is a help item for for Syndication, however, it refers to a "Site Feed" tab on my settings panel, and that item is not available.</p>
<p>If RSS syndication is not available soon, I will likely switch to some other software, in spite of the ease of Blogger Pro.</p>
