<p><a href="http://www.henshall.com/blog/">Stuart Henshal</a> recommended that I try out <a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.Bloggar</a> for creating blog posts. I'm giving it a try here.</p>
<p>So far seems interesting -- in addition to spell checking and handling some html related tasks, it appears to also have the ability to work with various plugins, for instance, a Windows Media Player plugin to display what music I'm playing right now.</p>
<p> <div class="media">[Listening to: Crimson (4-4) - Solace - Ahsas (04:15)]</div><br />
Stuart says that one of his favorite features is that the tool will post to multiple blogs at once, which is useful if you are maintaining a business and a non-business blog and yet some items will go into both.</p>
