<p>This year&#39;s topic is <a href="http://blogactionday.org/why-food/" target="_self" title="Blog Action Day — Why Food?">Food</a>, and this year many of my students of my <a href="http://www.bgi.edu" target="_self">BGIedu</a> class <a href="http://www.bgi.edu/voice-of-bgi/social-web-for-social-change/" target="_self">Using the Social Web for Social Change</a>&#0160;are using the day to help kick off their &quot;Beat Blog&quot; assignments. The goal of Beat Blogs is for each student to choose a topic they are passionate about and blog about it at least weekly for two and a half months. Many students decide to keep their blogs going afterwards, am I&#39;m always tickled when that happens.</p>
<p>Some of the blog posts by my students on the topic of Food:</p>
