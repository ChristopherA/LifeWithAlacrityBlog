<p>Game Designer and Pundit <a href="http://www.costik.com/">Greg Costikyan</a>: wrote in his blog a thought I can't believe that I've not heard of before, it makes so much sense. But it is new to me:<blockquote><a href="http://www.costik.com/weblog/2003_10_01_blogchive.html#106720019248778019">Games * Design * Art * Culture</a>: "Oh.... And you fellas. Sure, I like portraying the angry, um, middle-aged man... But, yet, I understand the importance of capital in bringing a product to market. But think about it: Back in the day, capital provided four essential things: development funding, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution. In the digital era, manufacturing is trivial; distribution is less of an issue; marketing is, if anything, harder; and for most products (not games or film), development is easier and cheaper. Under the circumstances, isn't a realignment of the percentage of revenues due to artists a vital necessity? They =should= get a bigger piece of the pie. And since manufacturing is trivial, and development easier, the whole thing should be cheaper to consumers.</p>
<p>And whoever figures out how to market effectively online is going to be worth.... well, more money than I shall ever see in one place."<br />
