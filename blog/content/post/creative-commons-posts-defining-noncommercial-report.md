<p>The topic is somewhat of a sticky one, as there are many competing interests. There are content creators who wish to profit from their work, there are other content creators who don&#39;t want anyone to profit (even themselves), and of course there are content creators who want everything to be free provided you share free content back.</p>
<p>There also is not agreement on what noncommerical means. There are some clearly commercial uses, but there are also various type advertising and sponsorship and use by non-profit or education institutions where money changes hands (such as a card at a museum gift shop). Finally, there is use in news or criticism where users feel that they are not restricted due to the rules of fair-use.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure that there is anything definitely &quot;new&quot; in this report, but there is some consensus and some interesting facts:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority (73%) of creators define “commercial use” as a&#0160;use where money is made, 76% of content users agreed.</li>
<li>33% of content users thought that individual use was&#0160;noncommercial use, whereas only 19% of the content creators&#0160;believed so.</li>
<li>Content creators rate uses by individuals as being less&#0160;commercial (89%) – unless the user is a professional who earns&#0160;money (35%)</li>
<li>13% of content users thought that fun, enjoyment, entertainment&#0160;and artistic use was noncommercial use, whereas only 3% of&#0160;content creators believed so.</li>
<li>52% of the content creators don&#39;t believe that content users&#0160;understand the noncommercial provision, and 43% believe that&#0160;content users don&#39;t respect the term.</li>
<li>50% of the content creators have been contacted about licensing&#0160;their noncommercial content, 24% of the content creators have&#0160;attempted to contact another creator about appropriate use of a&#0160;CC license.</li>
<li>There is a lack of agreement on a lot of edge cases of&#0160;noncommercial use. For instance, some feel cost-recovery is&#0160;acceptable noncommercial use, money exchanged hands for a&#0160;charitable use would be noncommercial, or use by a for-profit&#0160;company where no money changed hands would still be noncommercial.</li>
<li>There is some interesting analysis of what people might be&#0160;willing to change their mind about. For instance, before focus&#0160;group participation only 8% thought that use for charitable&#0160;purposes for social good would be noncommercial, but after the&#0160;focus group 17% did.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all an excellent report, with lots of good data in it for further investigation. If you are involved in user-generated content, offer users creative-commons licenses, or are a consumer or provider of commercial content online, I recommend you take the time to understand these issues more deeply.</p>
<p>My personal take on this report is that the noncommercial provisions of the CC license need more clarification and there needs to be more user education. In addition I feel that Creative Commons also needs to look at the commercial use side of the problem. I appreciate the recent efforts toward a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC Plus</a> metadata, but it isn&#39;t enough.

For instance Creative Commons should take a principled stand on what exactly &quot;fair use&quot; is; make it easier for those who offer NC licenses to also offer a standard commercial license for common uses; and possibly creating a standard for what &quot;fair rights&quot; are in commercial license (i.e. fair to both the content creator and the content user).<p></p>
<p>There are also problems in the area of attribution, as all Creative Commons licenses except Public Domain have the BY provision. These get particularly difficult when you have a remix of content from many creators. There&#39;s also difficulty in the fact that it&#39;s not stated what places attribution must be listed in. For instance, can you do a movie or a podcast with remixed content, but have the attribution credits be a link? Or must they be credits in the media itself?</p><p>All are interesting problems that I hope Creative Commons will address in the future.</p>
