		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Like many others, I've been paying attention to <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a> in the last couple of weeks. I've answered more requests to be &quot;friends&quot; on Orkut then I have of any of the other half-dozen Social Networking Services I've tried, and I've looking at other people's friends to see if I know anyone. I've yet to ask someone to join Orkut that wasn't already a member, and I've been careful to not have anyone as a &quot;friend&quot; that I didn't know reasonably well and I thought knew me. Currently I have 68 Orkut &quot;friends&quot;, many more then I have on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn</a>, which I've been using for several months and have 50 &quot;connections&quot;.</p>

<p>In addition to this activity on Orkut, I've been reading a lot of blogs about other people's experiences on Orkut. In particular, I've found Danah Boyd's blog <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">Apophenia</a> a great source for thought on social networking services, so I've got it near the top of my RSS aggregator. I'd just read her rant <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/venting_my_contempt_for_orkut.html">venting my contempt for Orkut</a> when I saw a follow up post <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.html">orkut pissyness round 2</a> where I read:</p><blockquote><p>Wanna see a big phat privacy hole on Orkut? Go to messages. Click compose. Click &quot;friends and friends of friends.&quot; Click next. Copy &amp; paste all of your friends and their friends' email addresses.</p></blockquote><p>I tested this out, and discovered she was correct, when I clicked &quot;friends of friends&quot; I got a long web page of names and email address. So I sent to this list I'd generated:</p>
<blockquote><p>A serious security hole? Yep.

</p>

<p>I just was shown 1137 friend and friends of friends email address, including your email address. As reported by Zephoria:</p>

<p>http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.htm</p></blockquote><p>I got a lot of replies back like &quot;What did you expect?&quot; and &quot;That is why I don't use my main email for Orkut&quot;.

</p>

<p>I also got a reply from Orkut Buyukkokten via email:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>Could you please send an email to your friends and friends of friends to tell them that there is no security hole?

</p>

<p>We worked very hard to ensure that the privacy of our members is not compromised in any way. I don't want our members to get the wrong impression.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreaciate it if you could pass the following message to you friends (:</p>

<p>You'll only see the e-mail addresses of people who chose to share them with you: if you mark your email address as not to be shared with friends and friends of friends, they won't be able to get your address this way. If you look at the list of people it's addressed to, you'll see that some are listed without addresses (unless you've got very permissive friends).</p></blockquote>

<p>Somewhat abashed, I checked, and since the last time I'd sent an email, the interface changed. I discovered that only 356 of 1137 of my friends of friends were actually allowing their email to be shown, and the rest now showed a &quot;lock&quot; icon next to their name. Of course, the first 100 or so on that list coincidentally allowed their emails to be shown, so I had assumed incorrectly that all had.</p>

<p>So I sent Orkut's reply out to my &quot;friends of friends&quot; and added links to my blog and this comment:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>I'm still quite uncomfortable with privacy issues of Orkut.com at this time. I've had to reveal more information then I'm comfortable, and the software is too lax in letting me see other people's info, for instance &quot;relationship status&quot; when I've marked myself as not interested in that. Maybe Orkut is just trying to be too much.</p></blockquote><p>I sent an email back to Orkut saying that I'd sent this email, then continued to get a lot of replies to my original email, and I discovered that I was now in Orkut &quot;jail&quot;. This meant that I could not send messages, could not add friends or groups, etc. No reason was given for why I was in jail. The only reason why I'd seen <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/2004/01/29.html#a2216">other people in jail</a> was because they had added too many friends too fast. I had only 50+ friends at the time, so I knew that wasn't the reason. I could only assume the worse.

</p>

<p>I'm out of Orkut &quot;jail&quot; this morning, but I still don't have any explanation of why. I continued to get replies both in support of my concerns:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>I tend to agree with you. I've learned more information than I expected about people. Also it's been a little odd to see people I know professionally on orkut, since I first conceptualized it as a social-friends service. (Then again, I've found professors on Friendster, which is much more explicitly social, so perhaps I'd better just accept that these people have lives.)

</p>

<p>At the same time, I think that Orkut's attempt to be all things to all people has helped it take off. I feel easier asking professional contacts to join orkut than I would for Friendster. It seems like less of a big deal to add someone to your orkut list rather than on another more focused service, as there is a level of plausible deniability as to intention. </p></blockquote><p>As well as comments like:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't want to be too harsh, but if perhaps you, and Danah, and Cory don't want to play then really no one is forcing you to play. But whining about things that you don't like is just, well, unseemly.</p></blockquote><p>I took a break to think on why I responded so negatively when Orkut has the appearance of doing something wrong (first, the 'security hole' that was a feature, and secondly the 'jail'). Then it came to me:

</p>

<p><strong><em>I'm insecure about orkut.</em></strong></p>

<p>Some of the definitions of 'insecure' are <em>not firm or firmly fixed; likely to fail or give way; lacking self-confidence or assurance; not safe from attack; lacking in security or safety; not financially safe or secure;</em>. The one that fits me the best is &quot;lacking self-confidence or assurance&quot;. Why do I feel this way about Orkut?</p>

<p>I guess my insecurity started out at the very beginning. As it is in beta, you can't join Orkut, you have to be invited. This made the place seem 'exclusive' and thus possibly safer. Yet right off it asks you some fairly personal questions: What is your relationship style? What is your sexual orientation? Who are you living with? What are your politics?</p>

<p>Later I find out by looking at other people's information that this is all completely public. It isn't limited to just friends, or friends of friends, but instead is prominent. In fact, other then your name and how many &quot;friends&quot; you have, your relationship style is the most prominent thing listed. Do I really want to know that my business acquaintance that I see only at technical conferences 2 or 3 times a year is in an open marriage? Or divorced? Or gay?</p>

<p>I live in the Bay Area and I've seen it all, and consider myself open and try to be consciously non-prejudiced. That's not to say that I'm comfortable when I'm hit on by another man, but for that matter, I'm not that comfortable when I'm hit on by a woman. The point is that I don't think about someone's sexual and personal choices when I interact with them. I don't care if you are gay, into S&amp;M, or any other radical lifestyle. I don't care if your straight, chaste, and christian. What I do care about is your relationship to me -- if you feel that it is important to your identity to let me know, well that is between us. But I'm not going to pry. I once had a male employee in my office that wore a dress to work -- I still don't know if he is gay or not. It didn't matter to me and he didn't tell me -- what mattered was that he was good employee.</p>

<p>This started my 'insecurity' about Orkut. Later I read that you couldn't delete your pictures or profiles. This worried me. Then I read that the system was down because of a XML hack.</p>

<p>When Orkut came back after the hack, a new feature was added, fans and ratings. This made me yet even more uncomfortable. Did I really want to have to not say I was a fan of someone that said they were a fan of me? Wasn't endorsing someone a far better signifier of fan? What does Trustworthy mean? Cool? I refused to enter anything for Sexy. I worried if someone could see my ratings, or reverse socially engineer it, or hack it.</p>

<p>Thus these insecurities of mine led me to think the worst and to post too quickly about the &quot;Friends of Friends Security Hole&quot; and still feel uncomfortable about why I was put in &quot;jail&quot;.</p>

<p>So far I've had no abuses of me by Orkut -- I've had only two people ask me to be friends that I don't know, and so far I've not been told that someone is my fan whom I'm not willing to honestly say that I'm a fan back. I've even found some old friends that I'd lost track of, which is exactly why I still &quot;play&quot; and not leave Orkut. I do believe that there may be something useful in these social network services.</p>

<p>Yet I feel that my old blog entry <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">Evaluating Social Network Services</a> that concluded with my take on <strong>The Perfect Social Network Service</strong> is still quite on track:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>My ideal service would have the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affiliations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryze, but less clunky.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'd add to that list that I'd like to have more control over my information, in particular, relationship information. That I'd like to see more &quot;progressive disclosure&quot; where there was more granularity of what was revealed at public, friends of friends, friends, fans, fans who I've endorsed, etc. Finally, I'd really not like to see things that are not applicable to me, such as relationship information of other people when I'm not looking for relationships, or professional information of others if I'm only using Orkut for dating.</p>

<p>[Update: another Orkut user and I found a different privacy hole when sending emails -- see <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/confirmed_email.html">Confirmed Email Privacy Hole at Orkut</a>.]</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the last few weeks I've gotten more invitations to friends via <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a> then I have from all the other social networks I've tried out. I currently have 61 friends there (and they are all people I know reasonably well), whereas in several months I have only 50 connections in <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn</a>. Oddly, the number of friends I have in each of these is less the older they are. In <a href="http://www.ryze.com/go/ChristopherA">Ryze</a> I have 36, and in <a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.Net</a> I have 32, and in my oldest FriendlyFavors, I have 5.</p>

<p>One good thing has come out of Orkut, I've found email addresses for some old friends that I thought I'd lost. Yet I am very frustrated by Orkut -- it made some minor user-interface improvements over some of the others, but fundamentally misses the boat. My biggest problem with Orkut is that it reveals far too much information -- do I really want to know that business associate Y is in an open marriage, or that X is gay and single? But that in some ways is minor problem -- the problem is that it appeals the "friend counter" evil angel on our shoulder, not to the "help me be a better member of my community" good angel.</p>

<p>Judith Meskill of <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/">The Social Software Weblog</a> asks <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/6832739961761474/">How Many Social Nets Are Too Many?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>by my count, there are more than 100 social networking services that I have been observing — cruising past my virtual radar gun — in the past few months. I have been tracking this burgeoning growth of services aspiring to help discover and connect my friends, potential partners, business cohorts, and various levels of acquaintances — and I have this scary feeling that I am only carving shavings off of the tip of an iceberg with this list.<p/>(snip)<p/><p><a href="http://www.affinityengines.com/" title="Affinity Engines">Affinity Engines</a>, <a

<p>Leander Kahney writes in Wired: <a title="Wired News: Social Nets Not Making Friends" href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62070,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3">Social Nets Not Making Friends</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Perhaps it was inevitable. A backlash is under way against social networking services like Friendster, as more and more companies crowd to join the latest hot Internet trend. Sick of invitations to join networking services, and the constant nagging to validate friends or acquaintances, some people are turning against the ever-growing social networking services.</blockquote></p>

<p>Danah Boyd rants about Orkut in <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/venting_my_contempt_for_orkut.html">Venting My Contempt for Orkut</a> and uncovers a <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.html">security hole</a> in it as well.</p>

<p>Right now only LinkedIn comes halfway to my expectations, and still has a long way to go. I still stand by my post of a month-and-a-half ago <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">Evaluating Social Network Services</a><br />
<blockquote>The Perfect Social Networking Service: My ideal service would have the the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affilations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryse, but less clunky. </blockquote></p>

<p>With so many others out there, they may all fail, and the good ideas that are hiding behind the bad will not survive.<br />

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At a recent unofficial gathering of <a href="http://finnern.com/future/">Future Salon'ers</a>, there was a discussion about a <a href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/1218/sony_06.wmv">demonstration of four robots doing a japanese fan dance to music</a> (I think it was seen at CES in Las Vegas last week). The remark was that it was vaguely disturbing because your intellect knows that they are just robots, but someplace deep in your brain you know that they are alive because of the way that they move.</p>

<p>There actually a wonderful web page on this topic, called <a href="http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/glimpses/valley.html">The Uncanny Valley: Why Why are monster-movie zombies so horrifying and talking animals so fascinating?</a> by <a href="http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/">Dave Bryant</a>.</p>

<blockquote>(Japanese roboticist Doctor Masahiro Mori) is not exactly a household name — but, for the speculative fiction community at least, he could prove to be an important one. The reason why can be summed up in a simple, strangely elegant phrase that translates into English as "the uncanny valley".

<p>Though originally intended to provide an insight into human psychological reaction to robotic design, the concept expressed by this phrase is equally applicable to interactions with nearly any nonhuman entity. Stated simply, the idea is that if one were to plot emotional response against similarity to human appearance and movement, the curve is not a sure, steady upward trend. Instead, there is a peak shortly before one reaches a completely human "look"... but then a deep chasm plunges below neutrality into a strongly negative response before rebounding to a second peak where resemblance to humanity is complete.</blockquote>The topic of the "Uncanny Valley" has also come up recently in a column by the movie critic Rodger Ebert, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/answ-man/sho-sunday-ebert11.html">Gollum stuck in 'Uncanny Valley' of the 'Rings'</a>, where he answers a question from a reader <i>"Should Andy Serkis, the actor of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, get an Oscar?"</i> where Ebert states:</p>

<blockquote>The genius of Gollum is that it seems like a convincingly real creature -- but not one we have ever seen before, so that its realism does not seem creepy except in the ordinary way. If Serkis brought Gollum to life, other artists fine-tuned the balance with the Uncanny Valley. So this is something other than a conventional performance, and should not compete against characters of a different nature. Perhaps a new category is called for? Beyond the Oscar of the Uncanniest Valley?</blockquote>I believe that the "Uncanny Valley" also applies to a number of other successes and failures in computer interface design. We loved <a href="http://www.bu.edu/jlengel/kn65kfs.mov">Apple's "Knowledge Navigator" video</a>, but in practice avatar-based systems have not been successful as they become a turn-off. Witness Microsoft's "Bob" and even Word's Paperclip avatar. When we see a little personality, a little "aliveness", we want a lot more, or it becomes annoying and we turn it off. However, the more "dead" it is, we are willing to forgive a lot.

<p>The "Uncanny Valley" also relates to my previous post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html">Seven Fingers of the Hand</a>, as part of the art of a circus is entering and leaving the valley. As a contortionist amazes you she is entering the Uncanny Valley. As the the clown amuses you he is entering the valley. When they come back to earth and join the others, they are human again.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday I watched the amazing <a href="http://www.les7doigtsdelamain.com/menu.html">Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a>. There were parts of it that were so beautiful and meaningful that I cried.</p>

<p>I decided to go because 2 of the 7 members have a history with the Bay Area "Pickle's Family Circus" which was a fabulous intimate circus that disbanded about 10 years ago. I loved the Pickles Family Circus because it was "human" -- I found Cirque de Soleil to be too cold and almost unhuman. What do I mean by this? Cirque de Soleil's acts have a tendency to try to be high art -- to divorce themselves from real people and become unemotional pure images of beauty -- even the clown acts seem a bit 'alien' to me. Every act of Pickle's, in contrast, was more human, with smiles and grunts and real emotions.</p>

<p>My favorite Pickle's act was a pixie-sized contortionist clown climbing all over a large barrel-chested MC. He would try to push her to the floor and she would keep climbing up on him such that he never succeeds. In spite of his size (and audience expectation) the big MC would do some acrobatic things that you didn't think a big guy like that could do. This would go on for 3-4 minutes, starting with frustration of the MC and the clowning pixie, and changing to their mutual appreciation of their differences -- the athleticism and largeness of the MC, and the flexibility and smallness of the pixie.</p>

<p>Seven Fingers of the Hand was everything that I hoped for, and more. When we arrived, we were led down the side of the theatre and all of a sudden I noticed that it looked like we were were all being led backstage. We curve around and all of a sudden see an entrance -- maybe 5 foot tall requiring most of us to duck. We duck through and to our surprise, we are have walked through a fridgerator, and we are on the stage!</p>

<p>One of the 7 players welcomes us, and another offers random people a glass of tea as we walk across the stage to our seats. The stage is set like a city loft, with a tv, some couches, a bed, a bathtub and shower, a kitchen, and of course the fridgerator we entered through. On the stage, and chatting to members of the audience are the 7 cast members, all wearing comfortable looking white shorts or athletic and white t-shirts.</p>

<p>The audience arrives over 30 minutes and the 7 players act as if we are guests of their loft, serving some of us tea, chatting, sweeping the floor, etc.  </p>

<p>Then as everyone is seated, a fabulous DJ (who besides being able to scratch can also sing and play various instruments) is introduced, and the show begins.</p>

<p>It is really difficult for me to describe the show itself -- there were over a dozen "acts" but they were all integrated together in such a way as to introduce the personalities and humanness of the players. I'll instead point you to these <a href="http://www.circuscenter.org/7Fingers/Reviews.htm">reviews</a> which describe it better then I can.</p>

<p>However, I can talk about what moved me -- first off, there was of course the beauty and athleticism of the players. In particular, there was the double 'tissu' act, a solo by the contortionist Isabele Chasse, hanging from two red silk curtain 20 feet above the stage, while the DJ played music on the theme of temptation.</p>

<p>Next there was the intimacy -- the Palace of Fine Arts is not a small theatre, but it felt intimate because of the way we arrived there and the way they treated us. Entering through the refrigerator door reminded me of the way you enter a Japanese tea house -- it requires to to humble yourself and bow to enter the new space.</p>

<p>Finally, there was a subtle theme, not at all obvious, of the 'teamness' of the 7 players. This included playfullness, creative conflict, minor jealousy, admiration, copying -- all as if the players lived in this loft together, like a cast of Friends. We were witness this artificact of their collaboration as if we were part of the collaboration.</p>

<p>I'm disappointed that they are leaving the Bay Area in a few days so that I can get all my friends to go, but I hope to see them the next time they return to the Bay Area and will drag all of my friends along.</p>
