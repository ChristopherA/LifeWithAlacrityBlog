		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of the common practices in the independent movie industry is to share favors to keep production costs low. I loan you use of a camera and you later do some editing for me on the cheap. Of course, it is often actually less direct then that: I loan you the camera, the community knows that I am generous, and when I need some editing time on the cheap, my social capital in the film community makes the resource available to me.</p>

<p>The real value of participating in this exchange is in the reciprocity and the social capital, but if the indie project is financially successful some ill will can arise about who really owes whom. One way that some creative producers deal with this is to have in effect two budgets, the real budget, and the virtual budget. Joss Whedon (creator and producer of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, <em>Serenity</em>, <em>Firefly</em>, <em>Dollhouse</em>, etc.) describes how he did this for his recent successful internet project&#0160;<a href="http://www.drhorrible.com/"><em>Dr. Horrible&#39;s Sing-Along Blog</em></a> in a recent <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2152">interview</a> at the Wharton business school:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdlasica/2858261316/" style=" float: right;"><img alt="Joss Whedon photo" border="0" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2858261316_40a63f6dd5_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Whedon:</strong> We got so much of this done through people doing us favors — department heads and people who have access to things. But you&#39;ve got to pay your day-to-day crew. The actors all did it for nothing. And we all did it for nothing. So, the production costs alone — the basic costs of filming the thing, and getting the locations, props and everything — ran a little over $200,000.</em></p>

<p><em>We had a secondary budget drawn up in case of a profit, wherein we were trying to find rates for Internet materials. In some cases they didn&#39;t exist. We used models that had been created by the guild for repurposed, or reused, material that we used for original [content], because this had never come up before.</em></p>

<p><em>We didn&#39;t want to leave a sour taste and say, &quot;Well, we made some money off of you guys being kind.&quot; It was like: No, everybody has to benefit from what they&#39;ve done, obviously not enormously — it&#39;s Internet money we&#39;re talking about — but as soon as we got in the black, we paid everybody off.</em></p>

<p><em>So that budget was probably about twice what the original budget was.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You&#39;ve now earned more than twice the original cost?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> Yes.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Which members of the production shared in the profits on the backend?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> The crew that got paid, got paid. [Those] who didn&#39;t get paid [included people like] department heads who had jobs and could afford to do this as a lark.</em></p>

<p><em>As we go forward into profit, there are also residual schedules and payment schedules for all of the creative people. We&#39;re trying to figure out how that works.</em></p>

<p><em>From the start I also laid down a gross participation scheme for my three key actors and the other three writers. While the guild was negotiating for one-tenth of a yen, I said, &quot;How about we just get into some percentages.&quot; It was an opportunity to say to the guilds, &quot;Guess how much better we can do&quot; — which, in the case of the Internet, is the only way for the guilds to survive.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve used a similar technique for internet startups, where the favors and the free time often fly wild and cause the entrepreneurs problems later.</p>

<p>My general rule of thumb is to get entrepreneurs to think one-third brains, one-third brawn, and one-third money. That is, people who bring knowledge, people, resources, brand, etc. get 1/3 of the outcome, people who actually work on the project get 1/3, and people who fronted the money or paid cash for expenses get the last third. Many people get a little equity from all three piles. If money comes in, the people who fronted cash get their money back first, then the other shares of revenues are distributed to everyone else based on the contributions.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a perfect model, but an afternoon of discussion with a team early on the entrepreneurial process--using this as a starting point for discussions — is often very successful in addressing future issues head-on before people become invested in differing expectations.</p>

<p>I suspect that many other industries may have interesting creative ideas on how to monetize favor if an outcome is good, but otherwise give out reciprocity of favors or social capital in the common good. Do you know of any of these?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <blockquote><dl><dt><em><strong>Extrapolate</strong></em></dt><dd><em>To infer an unknown from something that is known; conjecture.</em><span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><br />-- The Random House College Dictionary</span></dd></dl></blockquote>

<p><a href="mailto:mlasalle@sfchronicle.com">Mick LaSalle</a>, an acerbic movie reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, writes a regular column &quot;Ask Mick LaSalle&quot; in the Sunday paper, where he sometimes allows others to vent their displeasure at his movie reviews. In this week's <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/17/PKGJNCETV81.DTL">column</a> he says something that I find very accurate to my experience with the online medium:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As for why people get hostile when they hear a differing opinion, I go back to Spinoza's definition of love and hatred. He says that people love that which they think reinforces their survival and hate that which they think threatens their survival. I believe -- this is just my humble theory, now -- that when people hear an opinion that counters theirs, their minds extrapolate from that one opinion to imagine a whole philosophical system. And then they imagine how they would fare in a world run according to that imagined system. So they go from disagreeing to feeling threatened in a matter of seconds, and they lash out. Often they write letters that begin, &quot;You are obviously,&quot; and that's where they identify, not you, but the phantom they feel threatened by.</em></p>

<p><em>Over the years, I've been &quot;obviously&quot; liberal, conservative, gay, straight, humorless, frivolous, angry and deeply jealous of Tom Hanks. When I was 30, I remember getting accused of being a 45-year-old former hippie who drove a BMW, wore a Rolex and had done acid in the '60s. I'm not sure if I wrote back, but if I did, I would have said, &quot;Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.&quot; But, of course, that kind of letter is your key to acquiring distance. It lets you know that the person's real quarrel is with some middle-aged former hippie -- probably known as Dad -- and that you're just the vehicle for that day's projection.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I think that Mick LaSalle is exactly right -- I've seen this type of hostility based on extrapolation regularly in online mediums: in emails, newsgroups, wikis, blogs, etc. I've been guilty of it a few times myself, though usually for me the result is that I don't respond at all -- &quot;Oh, he is just a flaming liberal&quot;, &quot;She's an arch-conservative&quot; or &quot;He is a just a technophobe.&quot; I can then feel comfortable in ignoring the rest of his or her point of view rather then trying to understand it.</p>

<p>I doubt if explaining this theory to someone who writes a hostile message is useful -- they will take it as yet another attack, which will likely contribute to another cycle of flamage. But I do find Mick's theory useful as another way to read and understand hostile messages, and respond more appropriately.</p>

<p>Understanding this lets me add another widget to my social software toolbox: when a group process results in a hostile message, try to determine if the author is actually reacting to what you said or if their hostility is based on extrapolating to &quot;obvious&quot; generalities. This may not allow you to directly address the hostility, but it may help you better understand it and thus not contribute to the cycle of flames.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At a recent unofficial gathering of <a href="http://finnern.com/future/">Future Salon'ers</a>, there was a discussion about a <a href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/1218/sony_06.wmv">demonstration of four robots doing a japanese fan dance to music</a> (I think it was seen at CES in Las Vegas last week). The remark was that it was vaguely disturbing because your intellect knows that they are just robots, but someplace deep in your brain you know that they are alive because of the way that they move.</p>

<p>There actually a wonderful web page on this topic, called <a href="http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/glimpses/valley.html">The Uncanny Valley: Why Why are monster-movie zombies so horrifying and talking animals so fascinating?</a> by <a href="http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/">Dave Bryant</a>.</p>

<blockquote>(Japanese roboticist Doctor Masahiro Mori) is not exactly a household name — but, for the speculative fiction community at least, he could prove to be an important one. The reason why can be summed up in a simple, strangely elegant phrase that translates into English as "the uncanny valley".

<p>Though originally intended to provide an insight into human psychological reaction to robotic design, the concept expressed by this phrase is equally applicable to interactions with nearly any nonhuman entity. Stated simply, the idea is that if one were to plot emotional response against similarity to human appearance and movement, the curve is not a sure, steady upward trend. Instead, there is a peak shortly before one reaches a completely human "look"... but then a deep chasm plunges below neutrality into a strongly negative response before rebounding to a second peak where resemblance to humanity is complete.</blockquote>The topic of the "Uncanny Valley" has also come up recently in a column by the movie critic Rodger Ebert, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/answ-man/sho-sunday-ebert11.html">Gollum stuck in 'Uncanny Valley' of the 'Rings'</a>, where he answers a question from a reader <i>"Should Andy Serkis, the actor of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, get an Oscar?"</i> where Ebert states:</p>

<blockquote>The genius of Gollum is that it seems like a convincingly real creature -- but not one we have ever seen before, so that its realism does not seem creepy except in the ordinary way. If Serkis brought Gollum to life, other artists fine-tuned the balance with the Uncanny Valley. So this is something other than a conventional performance, and should not compete against characters of a different nature. Perhaps a new category is called for? Beyond the Oscar of the Uncanniest Valley?</blockquote>I believe that the "Uncanny Valley" also applies to a number of other successes and failures in computer interface design. We loved <a href="http://www.bu.edu/jlengel/kn65kfs.mov">Apple's "Knowledge Navigator" video</a>, but in practice avatar-based systems have not been successful as they become a turn-off. Witness Microsoft's "Bob" and even Word's Paperclip avatar. When we see a little personality, a little "aliveness", we want a lot more, or it becomes annoying and we turn it off. However, the more "dead" it is, we are willing to forgive a lot.

<p>The "Uncanny Valley" also relates to my previous post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html">Seven Fingers of the Hand</a>, as part of the art of a circus is entering and leaving the valley. As a contortionist amazes you she is entering the Uncanny Valley. As the the clown amuses you he is entering the valley. When they come back to earth and join the others, they are human again.</p>
