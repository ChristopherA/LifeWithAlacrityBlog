                                <p><em>(by Christopher Allen with Elyn Andersson and Shannon Appelcline)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.BGI.edu" style="float: right;"><img alt="BGIedu Logo" border="0" height="100" src="http://www.bgi.edu/files/BGI-Logomark-CMYK.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" width="100" /></a>Two years ago, the Bainbridge Graduate Institute (<a href="http://www.BGI.edu" target="_self" title="Bainbridge Graduate Institute">www.BGI.edu</a>) faculty gathered to radically reinvent their sustainable business curriculum for the next decade. Our goal was not only to update course content, but also to significantly update how the material was taught. We wished to make our teaching process (our pedagogy) more interactive and also more effective for students graduating into a 21st-century work environment, where people increasingly work in teams-both online and offline.</p>
<p>As a specialist in group interactions, I was asked by the faculty whether formal graduate student study groups (called &quot;Study Buddies&quot;) should consist of two people or of three. I did not have an easy answer to this question.</p>
<p>My expertise with group dynamics comes from professional experience as an entrepreneur and from considerable experience both building online communities and helping others to do the same. Through these processes, I&#39;ve seen how groups of people act differently at different sizes. As I discussed in my previous blog post on Group Thresholds [<a href="#Allen">Allen</a>], there are pros and cons associated with different group sizes. However, the smallest group that I spoke of in that article was the &#39;working team size&#39;, which is a group of four to nine members (but ideally about seven). I didn&#39;t talk about groups consisting of less than four members-specifically dyads (a group of two people) and triads (a group of three people)-and that was what the BGIedu faculty was now interested in learning more about.</p>
<p>My first inclination when considering BGIedu&#39;s request was to say that triads would be the best size for study groups, but I wasn&#39;t sure. I knew from my past research on group size that a dyad has a significantly different behavior than any other small groups. However, I wasn&#39;t certain if triads should also be considered on their own, or if they were just the low end of one of those &#39;work teams&#39;, which I&#39;d always thought of as containing four to nine members. Triads were a hole in my research.</p>
<p>I decided to dig deeper into this question by engaging my teaching assistant Elyn Andersson and my writing partner Shannon Appelcline to help me investigate further. This post is the fruit of our research and our discussions about dyads and triads. We hope it might help you decide whether a dyad or a triad is the better team size for groups that you are working in.</p>
<h1><a id="choosing" name="choosing"></a>Choosing between Dyads and Triads</h1>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain" /></a>Before I share with you the details of our investigation, I want to be clear that dyads, triads, and small &#39;working team&#39; groups can all be effective. Any challenge faced by groups of these sizes can be overcome by a good process, teamwork, training, or just positive energy. However, my thesis is that certain sizes of groups are better for certain purposes-and when a group size is selected appropriately it will require less energy and thus be more likely to be productive when the inevitable group challenges occur. When choosing among a dyad, a triad, or a working team, the important thing to focus on is thus the intent in forming the group.</p>
<p>For the groups being considered by BGIedu, the faculty felt that the students taking the new curriculum needed three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More formal support for studying (i.e. not ad hoc study teams);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inclusion of emotional support in that support structure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system where the members of a study group would help each other to keep their commitments to study.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last requirement - that members of these study teams would be accountable to each other without one student just taking up the slack of another - was the toughest one.</p>
<p>Clearly, working teams of 4-9 people were too large for our purposes. Teams this size are rarely intimate enough to support the needs of individuals. In addition, research shows that they are poor at supporting accountability. That&#39;s because working teams of 4-9 are very vulnerable to social loafing (i.e., slackers)-except when the tasks assigned to these working teams are highly independent (i.e. an entrepreneurial team that has different members focused on different topics, such as management, development, operations, marketing and sales) or when they require high diversity. An upcoming blog will cover this topic in more depth.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain" /></a>Removing working teams left the question of dyad vs. triad - which our research would show were both very different from working teams. Triads ultimately fit BGIedu&#39;s particular need better. That was primarily due to advantages of accountability and cohesion, combined with some emotional support. However, some simple numerical properties of triads also prove useful: they have elemental diversity because they&#39;re up to 50% more diverse than dyads; and if someone misses a team meeting the other two-thirds of the team can still benefit. For all of these reasons, my recommendation to the BGIedu faculty was that these formal study teams be formed in triads.</p>
<p>Dyads, however, are quite appropriate for a variety of other purposes, and should not be dismissed. I&#39;ll be talking of some of their advantages before proceeding on to the lessons learned about triads themselves.</p>
<h1><a id="dyad" name="dyad"></a>The Dyad</h1>
<p>Everyone has had experience with dyads. The first social experience of anyone&#39;s life is a dyadic relationship - that between a mother and her unborn child. This parent-child relationship continues once the child is born. Overall, dyads are the most common social group; they are seen everywhere, in personal, academic and business relationships.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94611163@N00/683866337/" style="float: right;"><img alt="Great Guitar Duo — Photo by Tom706 CC-BY-NC-ND" border="0" src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1108/683866337_4dd654b650_n.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>To decide if a dyad is the best group size for your needs, it is again important to focus on the purpose of the group. A number of interesting characteristics of dyads - some benefits and some limitations - make them unique from triads and other larger group sizes, among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Emotional Support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasoned Agreement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power Inequality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group Accountability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="emotional_support" name="emotional_support"></a>Emotional Support</h2>
<p>There have been some academic studies [<a href="#Taylor">Taylor</a>] that suggest that it&#39;s easier to be open and share within dyads. The research has shown that people feel safer about revealing personal and intimate information in a dyad than they do when a third person is added to the group. As a result, disclosure rates increase when people are put into dyads as compared to triads. Furthermore, adding a third person to a group causes its members to be more socially conscious, making it harder for members to listen to the conversation and at the same time be aware of their own thoughts.</p>
<p>Together it&#39;s this trust level (allowing for disclosure) and this focus level (allowing for better listening) that make dyads much stronger for emotional support than triads or larger teams. If the intent of a group is to have an intimate and fully open space, or if the work of the group is emotional in nature, this might make dyads a better choice.</p>
<p>Though dyads are clearly more effective for providing emotional support, triads can still offer that as well under the right conditions.</p>
<h2><a id="commitment" name="commitment"></a>Commitment</h2>
<p>This intimacy and confidentiality of a dyad helps its members to build strong team dynamics relatively quickly. The two individuals not only will have formed a trust bond more easily than three or more individuals could, but they generally will have a better ratio of time to performance outcomes compared to groups of larger sizes, in part because less time is spent maintaining the team relationship itself.</p>
<p>In a triad or larger group, the group would need to put effort towards team work over task work and thus less time is put towards performing the task. In other words, more resources would be spent on relating to a teammate than on finishing a project.</p>
<h2><a id="reasoned_agreement" name="reasoned_agreement"></a>Reasoned Agreement</h2>
<p>The most unique element of dyads is that they are the only group size in which one voice is paired against another voice equally.</p>
<p>When was the last time you were in dyad in which you did not agree on an issue? Most likely, you and the other individual spent some considerable time trying to convince the other of your reasons, and the outcome was one of two things: you either both stuck with your opinion and walked away, or one of you changed your mind after hearing the other&#39;s ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>Because members can&#39;t &#39;vote&#39;, a dyad is either in agreement or disagreement, which forces a longer deliberation for tasks when consensus is required. There are times when you want a small group to deliberate deeply, and dyads are ideal for this.</p>
<h2><a id="power_inequality" name="power_inequality"></a>Power Inequality</h2>
<p>Though dyads have several advantages, they can also bring with them a few additional problems - one of which is a power inequality of knowledge that would be detrimental within some teams. For some tasks, this could offset the benefits of having a more intimate small group. For my BGIedu groups, I was concerned that it might prevent some students from benefiting academically from the study exercise.</p>
<p>This topic has been addressed in a study <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604000972">[</a><a href="#Day" target="_self" title="Day">Day</a>] that compared homogeneous teams that were entirely high-ability or low-ability to heterogeneous dyads of mixed abilities. The study found that while high-ability people tested better individually after learning the material in a dyad with another high-ability team mate, low-ability people did not gain much benefit from studying in a dyad with a high-ability team member.</p>
<p>This was somewhat surprising. A student with more knowledge of a subject should be able to mentor a student with less knowledge, therefore creating a true dyad study partner. However, this study showed that this was not the case.</p>
<p>The study also argued against another common conception. One might assume that two high-ability team members could learn more together, when they could bounce ideas off of each other, than they could alone. However, this was again not the case: high-ability individuals performed better after learning alone than after learning with another high-ability team member! Only homogeneous low-ability teammates performed better after being in a dyad than alone.</p>
<p>This study pushed me toward triads for study teams at BGIedu, as dyads would not be large enough to guarantee high performance outcomes; the teams would always consist of one higher performing student and one lower performing student.</p>
<h2><a id="group_accountability" name="group_accountability"></a>Group Accountability</h2>
<p>Another disadvantage of dyads shows up in the area of accountability. The simplest version of this issue can be shown in this question: if one teammate says she did the majority of the work, while the other teammate says the work was shared 50/50, who was correct? A tougher question: if they both say that the work was shared 50/50, how is a third party able to determine if this actually was true?</p>
<p>Elyn, my teaching assistant, interned in a high school in Seattle while working towards her Master&#39;s in Teaching. Her experiences highlight this problem. In today&#39;s educational model, collaborative learning is highly valued, and Elyn worked to incorporate in-class group work into many of her lessons. When assessing the students&#39; group projects, however, she found that it was difficult to determine if the students shared the work equitably or if some of the students rode on the hard work of their partners. In some cases, Elyn doubted that the work was split equally. In particular, she found that if she let the students choose their own partners, the students were more likely to say that &#39;both&#39; did the work, rather than tell the teacher their friend slacked off on the assignment.</p>
<p>A recent study [<a href="#Alkaslassy" target="_self">Alkaslassy</a>]&#0160;supports Elyn&#39;s experience. In it, students working on a paired group assignment were asked to allocate the percent of work done between the pair. 86% of the students assigned equal credit between the two individuals in the group. At a surface level, one could presume that each party performed half the work and was honest in their assignment of credit. However, Elyn and I believe that in some dyadic relationships, friendship can become an overriding factor and that in those situations, students are more likely to allocate equal credit because of this friendship, not because of true equity.</p>
<p>In the psychological field, this relates to a well-known cognitive bias called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_bias" target="_self" title="Wikipedia: Egocentric Bias">egocentric bias</a>, where an individual will claim more responsibility for group action then an independent observer would credit them. Although this is most often discussed for larger groups, in dyads a member might rate their own efforts as being half of the effort when in fact is it is less. Thus in academic group projects, it can sometimes be more effective to have the students rate their peer rather than themselves.</p>
<p>Though group accountability can be a disadvantage for dyads, it improves when you have triads, thanks in part to a triad&#39;s inability to devolve. This, as it turns out, would be another comparative advantage that helped me choose triads over dyads for BGIedu.</p>
<h1><a id="triads" name="triads"></a>Triads</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yaketyyakyak/5991422366/in/photostream/" style="float: right;"><img alt="Fernando&#39;s Kitchen, Cambridge 30-07-11 —&#0160;Photo by Dave Catchpole CC-BY" border="0" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6123/5991422366_6301a83c43_n.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>There are a number of interesting characteristics of triads that make them different from dyads and also from small &#39;working team&#39; groups. I&#39;ll talk about three of them in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inability to Devolve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elemental Diversity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="inability_to_devolve" name="inability_to_devolve"></a>Inability to Devolve</h2>
<p>We all have experienced what happens when a party gets too busy or too noisy - the size of the conversation groups get smaller. If you are having an informal dinner for seven, sometimes the conversation will include the entire table. However while people are eating the conversation will typically devolve into smaller groups: four people at one end of the table will being having one conversation, while the remaining three will be talking at the end other. Sometimes one person will be left out of any conversation, but studies show that with small groups this is less likely to happen. We have a natural tendency not to want to exclude or reject individuals unjustly, so such a singleton will usually find a place in one conversation or another.</p>
<p>Working teams also have this natural tendency to devolve when confronted with external challenges (of which noise is one of the simpler ones) or internal challenges (such as differences of opinion), only reuniting when those challenges are resolved. A team of six can devolve gracefully a number of different ways: a three and a three; a four and a two; or three groups of two. Teams of five can devolve into teams of two and three. A team of four can devolve into two teams of two. In all of these cases the devolution does not exclude any individual&#39;s voice.</p>
<p>However, a triad can not devolve without excluding someone. Triads thus have a lot of subtle pressure to try to keep the group together, so that no individual is explicitly rejected - except for a good reason. This leads to more accountability for the individuals in the group, compared to teams of two where the dyadic nature of the group can override liability.</p>
<h2><a id="voting" name="voting"></a>Unconscious Voting</h2>
<p>A dyad&#39;s inability to vote was an advantage of that group size, and thus issues that require deeper deliberation are often better with dyads. However, you sometimes don&#39;t want as much deliberation. You want fast action.</p>
<p>I find that we unconsciously gauge each others&#39; opinions in a small group very quickly, and even more so with a triad. This means that a triad seems to be able to come to at least some decision very fast. There are many cases where this can be very useful - if that is the intent of your team.</p>
<p>As an personal example, I saw a presentation in the early 1990s from the Apple Human Interface Group (HIG) about their survey of how users colored &quot;folders&quot; on the Macintosh. The result was that there was little commonality - everyone colored folders differently for different reasons. Afterward, I met with the team and suggested that that if they instead asked teams of three to decide how to color code folders that they used together, then the results from all the different teams would have much more commonality. This suggestion ended up getting me a consulting job with Apple HIG, and shows how a triad can quickly create successful performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Triads are not the only group size that can vote easily - all odd size groups can - but I believe the voting of a triad to be fundamentally different because the voting can be so unconscious and informal that the members are not even aware of it. This can be useful, but it can also cause problems.</p>
<p>When I was just starting my business, I was doing a lot of work with a company formed by two partners who had a 50/50 stock split in their company. Theirs was a good partnership; they had very different but complementary skills and worked well and profitably together. As a fellow entrepreneur, I was a peer to both them, and we were developing a new product line together.</p>
<p>However, when I worked with them on this product line, I saw that I&#39;d changed their very successful dyad to a triad, and I thus became a tiebreaker in many of their business decisions - including business decisions on issues that had nothing to do with our joint product. This was caused by a shift in power: one partner might ask me a question about marketing rather than asking his partner (who knew marketing), and then it would become our opinion against the remaining partner&#39;s. Conversely, I found the marketing partner asking me to side with him on development questions.</p>
<p>I found this quite troubling; a more manipulative person could have controlled or broken that relationship by always breaking the ties in their own favor. In our case, we never shipped the product line and went our separate ways. I couldn&#39;t help but think it might have been because my unofficial &quot;vote&quot; was causing problems in their partnership.</p>
<p>When getting a result is the purpose of a team, a triad is better than a dyad as it allows for this voting to take place. As I mentioned to BGIedu, a triad can have a two-to-one vote, allowing a better chance at task accomplishment. Task accomplishment is also achieved because triads stay on topic better than dyads due of this voting ratio: if one member of a dyad decides to go off topic, it is easy for the other to follow his or her lead. In a a triad, two out of the three members would need to &#39;agree&#39; to follow an unrelated discussion.</p>
<h2><a id="elemental_diversity" name="elemental_diversity"></a>Elemental Diversity</h2>
<p>One final advantage of triads when compared to dyads is that the knowledge base of the group is larger. I saw this issue clearly in my recent Social Web for Social Change class at BGIedu, where I changed the team size from two to three, and immediately saw a growth in elemental diversity that benefited the groups.</p>
<p>In this class, I have the students participate in an exercise on personal branding. I originally had the students pair up in teams of two, effectively giving each student a &#39;branding buddy&#39; to help them form their personal brand and to give and receive feedback. In the last year, however, I decided to change this dyad to a triad.</p>
<p>At first, these groups followed the same methods I used for dyads: one person would self-brand themselves to a second person in the group, who would then echo back what they thought they heard the first person say, using their own words. However, it is difficult for two people to really hear the similarities and differences between what they said and what they heard. The third person thus became a neutral sounding board who told both individuals that spoke what they said. Together, all three could figure out the similarities and differences between the statements. After consensus is reached, all three students switch roles. I call this the Echo Exercise, and it shows how triads can be beneficial at times when the natural characteristics of dyads don&#39;t lead to optimum results.</p>
<h1><a id="finalnotes" name="finalnotes"></a>Final Notes</h1>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg" style="float: right;"><img alt="Tripal Spiral —&#0160;from Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain" border="0" height="150" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" width="160" /></a>As it happens, this article was created by a triad. It wasn&#39;t purposeful, nor was it meant to show off the findings of this article. Instead, the triad evolved naturally because it proved the best group size for writing this piece.</p>
<p>I came up with the initial concept for the article and wrote out the problem and introduction. Elyn then did considerable research and wrote up a rough draft of her findings. To that point, we were a committed dyad, working together in an organic way. However, we also had an article that felt like it was in two parts. That&#39;s when I had Shannon join us. He reorganized the article, unified its voice, and produced a final draft.</p>
<p>Though it wasn&#39;t purposeful, you can see the advantages of triads just from this example. Most notably, our triad made great use of elemental diversity. Though I held the core ideas and concepts for the article, Elyn provided the research expertise and Shannon provided the editorial expertise that were required to complete it. Voting also came into the equation (in the unconscious way that it tends to in triads) when Shannon effectively &quot;broke the tie&quot; of two different writing styles.</p>
<p>Since then, this triad has fallen apart. It&#39;s something that was created for a specific project and with all of our other tasks, we didn&#39;t have room for it going forward. Teams breaking apart is natural. Sometimes it happens under normal conditions (as was the case with this triad), and sometimes it happens as a result of unhealthy conditions.</p>
<p>I did not give BGIedu any advice at the time about the termination of a team, although it will eventually come up: some teams will end badly, and members of these groups may leave with an impression that a triad is a bad group size, even though the size did not lead the group to ending in an unhealthy way. Perhaps the groups should be counseled, or perhaps the members should jump right back on the triad horse ... but that&#39;s a topic for another article.</p>
<p>From here, I&#39;d like to open the conversation up to you. Have you had experiences in either dyads or triads that you would like to share? Were you one of the BGIedu students in a Study Buddy triad? Did the experiences match the studies shown here or did you have an experience that differed? We invite your comments.</p>

                                <p>In <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">my first article</a>&#0160;in this series I talked about community numbers: how the sizes of groups ultimately affect their success (or failure). However what I discussed only offers up the most rudimentary explanation of the dynamics, and that is because typically not all of the members of a group are equally involved.</p>

<p>In order to better define <em>who</em> constitutes the tightly-knit &quot;participant community&quot; upon which the group thresholds act, we have to study power laws which let us measure the intensity of individuals&#39; involvement in a group.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Power Laws</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366611997/" title="Pareto Principle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Pareto Principle" height="179" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3616/3366611997_95f255e4a3_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>The best-known power law is probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>, which is otherwise known as the &quot;80/20 law.&quot; It&#39;s been overused throughout the years; Pareto&#39;s actual law only said that 80% of the wealth would be held by 20% of the population.</p>

<p>However, it offers a fine example of how power laws work. They generally describe a discrepancy between intensity and population: inevitably, some people do a lot more of the work in any social situation. Other examples include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf&#39;s Law</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367563212/" title="Long Tail Curve by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img height="174" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3603/3367563212_8aa7a62c6f_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>which suggests that the frequency of a word&#39;s usage is inversely proportionate to its ranking among words (making the second ranked word appear half as much, the third a quarter as much, etc), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">long tail</a>, which talks about selling a very large number of items in a very small individual quantity.</p>

<p>For online communities, which have been the focus of most of my studies on the topic of community sizes, I&#39;ve found that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_inequality">participation inequality</a> power rule is very apt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366764093/" title="Participation Inequality by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality" height="192" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3613/3366764093_29495ce5b4_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>This term comes from Will Hill of AT&amp;T Laboratories, who said, &quot;A major reason why user-contributed content rarely turns into a true community is that all aspects of Internet use are characterized by severe participation inequality.&quot; It&#39;s often equated with the 1% law, though I like to be more precise and say that 90% of an online community tends to be lurkers, 9% tends to be intermittent participants, and 1% tends to be active participants.</p>

<p>These values heavily influence online community sizes that are larger than the tightly-knit communities group thresholds that I previously discussed.</p>

<h3>Power Laws &amp; Group Thresholds</h3>

<p>When I wrote about tightly-knit communities in my first article, I didn&#39;t consider the degree of participation. That&#39;s certainly an entirely valid model for some types of groups. Corporations, for example, ideally should be entirely filled with active participants, while Skotos&#39; online game <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/">Castle Marrach</a> also fits into the category due to the implicit requirements it creates for participation. There are some challenges to grow this type of community, since you&#39;re only searching for a specific type of high-energy participant — but they can be overcome if you offer sufficient incentive (such as a salary or a lot of internal feedback).</p>

<p>However, most communities, and in particular, online communities, will not fall into this category, and thus when we&#39;re looking at group thresholds, we have to measure them against the number of <em>active participants</em>, not against the number of total members. Thus, for groups which allow for non-participation, we&#39;ll often measure 10% (or maybe 1%) of the group size against the group thresholds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpg.net">RPGnet</a>, one of the community sites that Skotos runs, offers a good example of this. We regularly see monthly uniques of approximately 200,000 users. However we probably have about 20,000 active registered users, confirming the lurker:participant ratio. When we recognize that only 2,000 of those are particularly active participants and that they&#39;re divided upon 6 successful forums, we start to see how community numbers that actually match the group thresholds can gel.</p>

<p>You can reverse this approach and look at active participants first. During some recent consulting for a local non-profit organization with 60 active online members, I was able to infer that their broader community was around 6000, which turned out to fairly accurately predict the total number of people who came to their live events over the course of a year.</p>

<p>Generally, this logic can be applied to a community of any size. You first measure whether it&#39;s an all-participant community or one that matches an existing power law, and then you use the corrected community number to truly measure which of the group thresholds may apply to it.</p>

<h3>Power Laws &amp; Leaders</h3>

<p>The power laws can also help you to measure the number of leaders in a community. Inevitably all of your participants will become leaders of some sort, while your high-level participants will become the top-tier leaders.</p>

<p>I noted this in my first discussions of group threshold. In a group of 7 members, you can reasonably expect to have one higher level participant, and thus the one leader that we saw naturally appear. Similarly in a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number">Judas group of 13</a>, there&#39;s the opportunity for more than one leader to appear, creating the possibility for the first hierarchical conflicts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609602/" title="Participation Inequality 90 9 1 by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality 90 9 1" height="153" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3367609602_4445e5cfb9_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>Understanding your count of leaders can help you see how to grow groups. For example when I first created <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com">iPhoneWebDev</a> I had to do an immense amount of effort to grow the community. This is because with Participation Inequality I had to grow the group by 10 members before I got the least amount of help increasing the content of the group and I had to grow it by 100 members before I had someone who was doing as much work as I was to create content.</p>

<p>At 100 members, with my first active participant, we continued to grow, but we were both were working hard and felt rather lonely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366786135/" title="Participation Inequality 700 70 7 by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality 700 70 7" height="196" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3366786135_53f8ebcf47_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>I finally saw the group stabilize, then take off on its own, when it hit 600-700 members, and that shows how beautifully the power logs work hand-in-hand with the group thresholds. With 700 members, I could reasonably expect there to be 7 leaders. In other words, I had a committee of leaders: the perfect size for a starting&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Working_Group">working group</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>From my experience with other online groups, if the iPhoneWebDev grows to over 10,000 members, I can expect that there will be some transition issues. As the core active community members exceed 100 people I will start having some <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number">Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number</a> problems, typically social contract failures. These can be solved by either adding some hierarchy (appointing some people to be official &quot;staff&quot;), or by starting to break the group into sub-communities.</p>

<h3>Varying the Power Laws</h3>

<p>In my first article, I noted that it&#39;s possible to expend additional energy to make tightly-knit groups able to function effectively at non-optimal sizes. It is similarly possible for the values of the participation inequality sized groups to change by expending more energy. Conversely, a drain on energy&#0160;may decrease this ratio.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609374/" title="Participation Inequality - High Energy by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality - High Energy" height="169" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3367609374_3975fe9bf7_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>For example when I used to run AOL forums I would frequently reward first-time participants with free time (at that time worth $5 an hour) if they asked good questions or offered valuable input. CompuServe similarly offered constructive feedback by telling users how many responses they&#39;d received to a new comment when they logged back in, encouraging them to leave lurker status. More energy in the community — driven either by the moderators, good social software design, or by a greater commitment by its members — can allow you to increase the active participant percentage, maybe times 2, or even 4, but even with a lot of effort not by an order of magnitude.</p><p>As a group grows in size, I believe the participation inequality worsens. A huge Yahoo! group with a million members might have moved from a 90/9/1 ratio to 95/4.5/.5. I suspect this is because the energy required to change the participation inequality numbers is so large as to not be economical.</p>

<p>There are also some interesting interrelations between the numbers of people at the various levels of participation. Though discovering 100 new members has a good chance of adding 10 new participants, 1 of whom is very active, my experience has been that things trickle-down in the other direction as well: that adding 1 new high-level participant can lead to the creation of 9 medium-level participants and 90 lurkers (though don&#39;t let that suggest that all of your effort should be expended on the high-level participants only).</p>

<h3>Looking at Participation Inequality</h3>

<p>Here is a close look at four online communities, using the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/">quantcast.com</a> metrics service, where you can see some participation inequality in action:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609306/" title="Participation Inequality - quantcast.com by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality - quantcast.com" height="235" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3367609306_023c85652f_o.jpg" width="961" /></a>

</p><p>From this you can see a typical online community site shows the normal 90% 9% 1% participation inequality. RPGnet shows a slightly better then average participation inequality due to its longevity and the quality of the community. ObesityHealth shows evidence of a great community with its 4% active participants, probably because you have to be very committed if you are going to have bariatric surgery. Last, an example of relatively&#0160;unhealthy&#0160;community that is unable to sustain its active participants.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful when analyzing quantcast numbers if you see active participants of greater then 6% — in almost all cases if you look deeper it is because there is some restriction that keeps people from lurking, either a fee or some other type of gateway, causing a distortion in the statistics.

</p><h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Multiple factors influence the success (or failure) or community. As we saw in my&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">first article</a>&#0160;on community numbers, the first factor is the&#0160;differing&#0160;group thresholds of community sizes. In my&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">second article</a>, I show that&#0160;personal limits on the number of people you can have intimacy and trust with is an important factor. In this article I show that larger groups are subject to the power law of participation inequality, causing a small fraction of a community to be subject to group thresholds. In all three articles I show how expending energy can allow you to change the numbers, but with limits.</p><p>I hope this discussion of community numbers will give you some tools to look at the communities you are in, or are trying to build, and to better understand how to make them more successful.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">previous</a> post, I talked about the limits on sizes of tightly-knit communities. These group limits are closely related to a number of interesting personal limits, and are often confused with them.</p>

<p>Unlike the group limits, personal limits actually measure something different: the number of connections that an individual can hold. They're yet another thing that you must consider when thinking about communities of people.</p>

<h3>Personal Limits</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3054773873/" title="Support Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3183/3054773873_07514d66dc_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Support Circle" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"/></a><strong>The Support Circle:</strong> This is the number of individuals that you seek advice, support, or help from in times of severe emotional or financial stress. In most societies, the average size of an individual's Support Circle is 3-5. The people are the core of your intimate social network and most typically are also kin. In sociology papers this is often called the &quot;support clique&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563324/" title="Sympathy Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3055563324_f62dbcdc7d_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Sympathy Circle" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a><strong>The Sympathy Circle</strong>: This is larger then the Support Circle — it is the number of people that you go to for sympathy and also those people whose death would be devastating to you. The Sympathy Circle typically is in the range of 10-15 people, but can vary widely from as few as 7 to as many as 20. The Sympathy Circle often may be made up of kin, but usually includes some peers as well.</p>

<p>In sociology papers the Sympathy Circle is also known as a &quot;sympathy group&quot;, but I wanted to avoid the term &quot;group&quot;, as it is implies that all the members of a Sympathy Circle are connected. Instead, members of your Sympathy Circle will have additional people in their own Sympathy Circles that are not part of your own.</p>

<p>An interesting issue with the Sympathy Circle is that as a personal limit, 10-15 is a typical size. however, if you bring them all together in one place, they will likely become a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number">Judas-Number-sized group</a>, with all of the problems associated with that size.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563798/" title="Trust Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3055563798_5355b9b99c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Trust Circle" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a><strong>The Trust Circle</strong>: These are the people that you have some type of intimate connection to. One study measured it as the people that you would send a family Christmas card to, while another simply tested emotional closeness.</p>

<p>In pre-Friendster days the Trust Circle would be those people that you considered your &quot;friends&quot;, however today the meaning of that term has begun to change. In my own usage, your Trust Circle are people that you have strong ties to and that in some measure you can trust. I have also called the Trust Circle your personal "intimate social network".</p>

<p>The size of different individuals' Trust Circles can vary widely (40-200), but <a href="http://delicious.com/christophera/trustcircle">some studies</a> show that the mean is on the low side of 150. This has led a number of researchers to compare this number with the Exclusive Dunbar Number of 150. However, I believe that this is a mistake; they are related, but in today's society members of your Trust Circle are rarely in the same mutual group.</p>

<p><strong>The Emotional Circle</strong></p>

<p> I personally define your Emotional Circle as the total number of people that you can have some type of non-mutual emotional connection with, most likely spread across numerous groups of all sorts. You &quot;like&quot; them in some way, but do not necessarily have to have strong ties to them.</p>

<p>In academia this threshold is called &quot;social channel capacity&quot;. A <a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/channel+capacity+christophermccarty">study</a> using two different methods to estimate, both suggest that it falls right around 290. However, I like to describe this number as &quot;just short of 300.&quot; As I wrote in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar Triage</a>, many people confuse this number with the Dunbar Number (and in fact I have in some of my older pieces). However, like the Trust Circle, it's a distinct entity.</p>

<p>Emotional Circle size can vary quite a bit from individual to individual. Some people might have half the average capacity, and others considerably more — which is much more variation than you see among the sizes of smaller personal thresholds.</p>

<p>Some of those variations are individual, but some are societal. As I wrote in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/07/cheers_belongin.html">Cheers: Belongingness and Para-Social Relationships</a>, I believe that our modern era of television causes us to create para-social relationships with imaginary characters who we nonetheless become emotionally involved with, and thus might reduce our social channel capacity.</p>

<p>Is our Emotional Circle smaller today because of TV or is it higher because online communities can help to remind us of our emotional connections to other people? That's a topic that probably deserves more study.</p>

<p>An interesting point to make is that the people who are in your Emotional Circle, but are not in your Trust Circle, are your &quot;weak ties&quot; in social network terms. What is important about weak ties is that <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/225469">studies show</a> (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf">pdf</a>) that opportunities and knowledge flow to you much more through weak ties than through the more insular strong ties of your trust circle.</p>

<p><strong>The Familiar Stranger</strong></p>

<p> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dlytle/2215047019/" title="Familar Strangers, from Blue Bottle Coffee Line by davitydave on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2125/2215047019_80e572fe0d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Familiar Strangers" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>Outside of our Emotional Circle is a larger, more tenuous circle: those people whose faces you recognize, but who you know nothing more about. These are your &quot;Familiar Strangers&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/familiar+stranger">Studies show</a> that the percentage of familiar strangers in your vicinity has a real impact on your willingness to take risks. If you are in a new place with no one that you recognize, you'll avoid eye contact and will generally be unwilling to approach strangers. In a place where there are a lot of people that you've seen before (say in your favorite cafe, at a conference, or in the lunchroom of a large company), you'll be much more willing to take risks, such as asking questions, or sitting down next to someone to eat lunch.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find any studies to show how many people that we can recognize, but for some people it is much larger than the number of people in your Emotional Circle, probably well over a thousand. However, there is also a lot more variance: some people are face-blind or near face-blind, and have a difficult time even recognizing friends.</p>

<p>There could also be some interesting research looking more closely at social network software. I find it fascinating that the professionally-oriented social network LinkedIn resisted supporting photos in profiles for so long yet ultimately failed, as well as how other social network software companies have attempted to require &quot;real&quot; photos of people rather then allowing "fakesters" or avatars.</p>

<h3>Crossing the Circles</h3>

<p>I've used the term &quot;circles&quot; throughout this article because it's a great metaphor for these levels of personal involvement. They can literally be thought of as concentric circles of people getting further and further away from an individual.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3054729757/" title="Personal Circles Landscape by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/3054729757_4fa37f7a6e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Personal Circles Landscape" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>However, if you want to consider them with an even more graphic bent, think of these circles as the ridge lines of a topographical map. An individual sits at the center, and around him lie many other people, fading slowly away as the distance increases.</p>

<p>Winding through these topographical lines, like forests or rivers, are geographies of physical and emotional connection.</p>

<p>Kin are one of the most interesting geographies, because they lie all across the map. There's a clump of them in the innermost circles, but there are also many who lie in the realm of Familiar Strangers, including those cousins and great-aunts who you only see at family gatherings, and whom you know nothing about.</p>

<p>There are also forces being exerted upon the circles, acting like gravity to draw people together. They are the forces of trust, influence, and more. Their pulls are greatest toward the center, across your Circles of Support and Sympathy, but as people move farther away, these forces drop off quickly.</p>

</p>Thus, though I've described them as circles, with strict boundaries, we should also see these personal connections as fluid entities, a regular ecosytem of personal community.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Whereas the group thresholds that I discussed in my last article define the limits placed on community group size, the personal limits described herein instead define the limits placed on how many people an individual can know with various degrees of intimacy.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are societies where these two things might be the same. A true survival community might contain everyone a person knows, and thus he could draw out all his personal circles across that community canvas. However, in our modern era they're much more likely to be distinct, with an individual interacting with the members of his circles of acquaintances through numerous different group communities.</p>

<p>With this bifurcation of personal and group community limits, we have to briefly stop and ask a few questions. How do they relate? What can personal limits tell us about efficient community creation? Does founding a group upon a personal circle make its growth easier or harder? Conversely, what type of communities lead naturally to the creation of intimate circles?</p>

</p>Herein I've simply outlined personal thresholds as a contrast to group thresholds. The exploration of how these limits interact is worthy of additional studies.</p>

<p>In my next article &quot;Community by the Numbers, Part III: Power Laws&quot;, I will talk about how both group thresholds and personal thresholds have a role in larger, less tightly-knit groups.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/circle_of_hands.jpg"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/circle_of_hands.jpg" title="Circle of Hands" alt="Circle of Hands" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
We often think of communities as organic creatures, which come into existence and grow on their own. However, the truth is they are fragile blossoms. Although many communities surely germinate and bloom on their own, purposefully creating communities can take a tremendous amount of hard work, and one factor their success ultimately depends upon is their <em>numbers</em>.</p>

<p>If a community is too small you'll often have insufficient critical mass to sustain it. Conversely, if it's too large you can end up with a community that's too noisy, too cliquey, or otherwise problematic. These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.</p>

<p>We can analyze these community sizes in three ways. In this first article I'm going to talk about numerical group thresholds that have been observed in various sizes of tightly-knit communities, while in its sequel I'm going to talk about personal thresholds and how they relate to group thresholds. In my final post, I'm going to consider how power laws and inequalities of participation further complicate these simple values in the creation of larger communities. Together these three articles constitute what I call &quot;Community by the Numbers,&quot; a theory of community size.</p>

<p>Though I'm going to point to some studies which support these numbers, in general my goal here isn't to try and prove this theory of community size numbers, but rather to lay the theory out completely.</p>

<h3>Tightly-Knit Group Thresholds</h3>

<p>Groups can clearly exist at any size, from a partnership of two, on upward. However what I'm going to write about here are the threshold values: the ideal numbers where a community seems to function best, and the less than ideal numbers at which a community begins to grow unstable, remaining so until a new threshold number is reached.</p>

<p>I'm also specifically talking about groups that are both tightly-knit and participatory communities. Clearly Ford Motor Company, with 250,000 employees, doesn't match any of these group thresholds. But any self-contained community within Ford probably will (and in fact, it will probably be either a &quot;Working Group&quot; or a &quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Group&quot;, both terms I'll explain below). Similarly, a non-corporate community that doesn't <em>require</em> everyone to participate won't work quite the same as a community that does require participation from each member (though that's again the topic of the third article in this series).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.singers.com/jazz/group7.html"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/group7.jpg" title="Group7" alt="Group 7" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
<strong>7, &quot;The Working Group&quot;.</strong> <a name="Working_Group"></a>
This community size probably runs from about 4-9 members, but 7 is a pretty good average, and one that shows up in <a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/workinggroup">multiple studies</a>. This number may well relate to the general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_seven">rule of seven</a> (<a href="http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/">original paper</a>), which suggests that 7 is a number that the brain can easily and intuitively comprehend.</p>

<p>It has become increasingly clear that a tightly-knit group of 7 is the first group size which is truly an optimal community size. Groups below this size can function effectively, but risk not having
enough manpower to deliver a result that everyone is happy with, or having insufficient viewpoints to avoid group think. </p>

<p>Seven is not only an optimal size for a wide variety of corporate and government committees, it is also a healthy size for a small business and even a good size for a party of close friends. More importantly, 7 is a very comfortable group size as it &quot;feels&quot; relatively natural. At this size members find it easy to get to know the other members of the group, and they're able to function well together in a very intuitive and organic fashion.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=560,height=403,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="143" border="0" alt="Squad and Fire Team" title="Squad and Fire Team" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
An interesting example of this group size is the modern infantry
&quot;squad&quot;, which consists of two fire teams of 4 people, and a squad
leader, for a total of 9 people. Each fire team is is large enough to
function on its own, but together the group of 9 can still have effective
small group dynamics.</p>

<p>It is typically at this size that the first signs of leadership in a group informally emerge, but the leadership usually isn't overbearing at this level, nor does there tend to be any rebellion against it — perhaps because the group may be too small to elicit multiple leaders.</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)"><img width="200" height="109" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/lastsupper.jpg" title="Last Supper" alt="Last Supper" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a><a name="Judas_Number"></a>
13—&quot;The Judas Number&quot;.</em></strong> A group size of 13 doesn't represent a threshold ideal value, but rather a threshold nadir. It is one of the points where groups can change behavior and risk becoming dysfunctional. There's one of these nadirs beyond every group threshold, where the previously harmonious group dynamics become more difficult. I've chosen to highlight this specific number because it's a point that small communities often hit, particularly as entrepreneurial organizations try to grow above their startup beginnings.</p>

<p>(I should note that 13 isn't a precise number, but rather one offered because it's in the right range and because it's poetically easy to remember. The exact number occurs somewhere between 9 and 25, but I suspect it is worst in the range of 12-15.)</p>

<p>In a group of this community size no one ever feels like they get a fair share of time. Studies show that at this size participants underestimate the amount of time they contributed to the conversation, and thus will come out feeling like they were unfairly ignored despite having a fair share of the conversation. Groups of this size risk people being lumped into categories and ceasing to be trusted as individuals. In addition, problems start with the development of &quot;too many chiefs,&quot; yet there is not enough enough variety of non-chiefs for them to direct. Furthermore, multiple leaders may struggle for hierarchical status, increasing the conflict in an already troublesome group.</p>

<p>If your community is unfortunately stuck at this nadir, one of two things usually occurs.</p>

<p>Most commonly, the group shrinks. This could be because participants unhappy with the group dynamics abandon it; or it could occur in a more organized way with the unwieldy large group breaking into two or more smaller groups. For example, a terrible group of 13 could become two more functional groups of 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Alternatively, more energy could be expended. This could be in the form of more formal organization, rewards for participation, or more time to be casual and socialize in order to shake off the tensions of this size group. Though these efforts don't usually change the size of the group, they can improve its dynamics.</p>

<p>Energy could also be spent to help push the group up to the next threshold. Though this could occur naturally — for example if the group focuses on a topic of particular interest that causes new people to continually be added. In addition, in order to grow a group to a new threshold it often requires the efforts of more than one leader to succeed.</p>

<p>A group size of 13 isn't necessarily bad, just more difficult. Anthropological studies show that primitive hunting tribes often temporarily broke into &quot;bands&quot; of this size — my presumption is that the value of having that many people hunting together outweighed the social costs of the group. It is interesting that most juries are made up of groups this size. I believe that the social dynamics of this size of group with all new members creates some tension among the jurors, which may serve justice to make sure that all sides are considered by the jury without falling into groupthink. However, from my experience, the interpersonal conflict in a jury can also slow down the deliberation process and cause much frustration among the participants.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png"><img width="200" height="166" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png" title="Non-Exclusive Networks" alt="Non Exclusive Networks" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
50—&quot;The Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot;.</strong> <a name="Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number"></a>More properly this group size falls in the range of 25-75 participants, but it seems to feel the most natural in the range of 50-60. Studies of the sizes guilds in online games <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html">support</a> this hypothesis. For instance, based on graphs of the guild sizes in Ultima Online, groups have a median of 61 members. Similar numbers hold true in studies of a more recent game, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html">World of Warcraft</a>.</p>

<p>I call this value the &quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot; because it matches the lower end of a threshold that <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Robin Dunbar</a> set for group sizes. However, at this size it applies to mostly non-exclusive groupings, which includes the above mentioned online guilds, many employee communities, and the majority of social gatherings that manage to rise above the size of a Working Group. Groups of this size <em>can</em> be serious or take up a lot of time, but in general they are not exclusive — they don't tend to be the only group that individual participants are involved in.</p>

<p><strong>90—&quot;The Dunbar Valley&quot;.</strong> As Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number communities grow, they reach a point where increased time obligations and the noise of socialization required to keep the group cohesive requires a much more serious commitment from the participants. Like the Judas Number, the Dunbar Valley is a threshold nadir where more energy is required to keep a tightly-knit community together;&nbsp; either the community agrees to a higher level of commitment and grows to the next level, or the community splits apart.</p>

<p>I've found this to be true when growing a small business — where it is too small for any middle-management, but the sub-groups are too large for one person to manage effectively. I've also seen this with more ephemeral groups, such as when a small conference that worked well at 60 participants tries to grow and finds at at 100 participants they can't sustain a high enough intimacy level.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=290,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="145" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg" title="Roman Legion" alt="Roman Legion" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Another illustration of the Dunbar Valley is the history of the ancient Roman &quot;century&quot;, a grouping that was originally 100 soldiers. However, as the years went by, centuries tended to decrease in numbers to only include 70 or 80 soldiers. This might well be due to Non-Exclusive Dunbar constraints: even in a very devoted group of military men, there was still the need for relationships with other century groups, with support staff, and with camp followers, ultimately lowering the attention that could be spent on the century itself.</p>

<p><strong>150—&quot;The Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot;.</strong> Robin Dunbar got much of the discussion of group thresholds started with his <a href="http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/dunbar93coevolutionOf.html">article</a>, &quot;Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans.&quot; However, as I've written <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">previously</a>, and as I've described in this article, Dunbar's group threshold of 150 applies more to groups that are highly incentivized and relatively exclusive and whose goal is survival.</p>

<p>Dunbar makes this obvious by the statement that such a grouping &quot;would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.&quot; </p>

<p> The result of the grooming requirement is that communities bounded by the Exclusive Dunbar Number are relatively few. You will find hunter/gatherer and other subsistence societies where this is a natural tribe size. You'll also find these groups sizes in <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/03/what_is_the_opt.html">terrorist and mafia</a> organizations. </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=430,height=279,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg"><img width="200" height="129" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg" title="The Sopranos at Dinner" alt="The Sopranos at Dinner" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Clearly, as we step up toward higher group thresholds, more and more
time is required to simply keep the group going. You see this in
depictions of mafia life — in the TV series <em>The Sopranos</em> a lot of time
is spent dining, hanging out, and drinking together. That is part of that 42% social
grooming time required for that intense of a survival group.</p>

<p>It is possible for a large company to force groups up to this size by expending lots of energy (which is to say money) to keep it healthy. Apple did this during the invention of the Macintosh, the first OS X operating system, and the iPhone, but the intensity required of such large teams is not sustainable for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Without that extra energy, few modern tightly-knit communities can reach this threshold, or else can't hold it for very long. Instead they fracture into groups of individual interest (even if they continue to &quot;meet&quot; in the same real-world or online forum), which are more than more likely to be bounded by the Non-Exclusive Dunbar number.</p>

<p>Given the difficulty in even arriving at the Exclusive Dunbar number, it may well be the highest limit of all for a tightly-knit community. Beyond this limit, communities are less cohesive, less trusted, and less participatory (and the topic of my third article in this series.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are many different ways to measure groups, and one is by counting its members. As I've discussed here, the number of members can have a huge impact on whether the communities are successful or not. Thus, as community organizers, social software engineers, game designers, or as sociologists interested in community dynamics, we must ultimately consider group thresholds and group nadirs; to understand how to create cohesive communities, rather than groups that fly apart.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">next article</a> I'm going to talk about thresholds that are personal, rather then group-oriented.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There is some more excellent research this week by <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/">Nick Yee</a> and <a href="http://www.parc.com/nicolas">Nicolas Ducheneaut</a> in the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/">PlayOn</a> blog. Again, their research provides good insight into social group dynamics as they appear in online games.</p>
<p>I last mentioned their research on guild sizes in my blog post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html">Dunbar &amp; World of Warcraft</a> where I compare the distribution of guild sizes in <a href="http://www.uo.com/">Ultima Online</a> vs PlayOn&#39;s results from <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a>. However, both distribution tables suffer from a variety of biases due to the nature of the different game designs, many of which are discussed in the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html#comments">commments in the post</a>. For instance both guild graphs include &quot;alts&quot;, which are alternative characters of individual players. Thus one player might be represented multiple times in a guild.</p>
<p>In Nic &amp; Nick&#39;s more recent research, they are looking deeper and are <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html">mapping social networks</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090425222428/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html">Internet Archive</a>)</em> on World of Warcraft. Using tools available to them, over the course of the month of August they looked at 241,378 characters and 5569 guilds. From that data they were able to able to discover how often guild members were co-present (online at the same time) or co-located (online and in the same zone in the game)</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="G-3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-500wi" title="G-3" /></a></p>
<p>For example, in this map you can see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...we have a guild where we see more distinct cliques. There&#39;s a somewhat hard-core 4 character cluster on the left- hand side, a mid-level triad on the bottom left, a mid 20&#39;s clique that&#39;s held together by the druid in the middle, and finally a more casual low-level clique on the top right.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this same data, they then looked at the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">max subgraph size of guilds</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use&#0160;<a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">Internet Archive</a>)</em>. A &quot;subgraph&quot; in a social network can be thought of as a &quot;clique&quot; of people that interact with each other.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image005" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-500wi" title="Image005" /></a></p>
<p>For instance, in the social network of this guild there are 5 subgraphs, 4 of which are just 2 people and 1 subgraph that is of 6. The 4 subgraphs that are only of 2 people are members of the guild who did not participate much in the guild. But the number of people in the subgraph of 6 is much more interesting, as it shows that these members are &quot;cohesive&quot;.</p>
<p>When the max subgraph size of a guild is plotted against the guild size, you get some interesting results -- the maximum guild cohesiveness occurs around the guild size of 50. Larger then that, guilds have a much more difficult time remaining cohesive.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image011" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-500wi" title="Image011" /></a></p>
<p>These results strong support my hypothesis in my original <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> post, where I...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &quot;grooming&quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&#39;t have requisite variety.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some possible other support for this hypothesis comes from another post by Nic &amp; Nick where they analyze the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html">time guilds spend together</a>&#0160;(now 404, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119142033/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html">Internet Archive</a>).</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image004" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-500wi" title="Image004" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the mean amount of time that guilds spend together in the band 31 - 60 is only 95 minutes and that the standard deviation is the lowest, as compared to groups that are larger then 120 where the mean time is 141 minutes at the standard deviation is higher. This says to me that keeping a large group cohesive requires significantly more time in social &quot;grooming&quot;.</p>
<p>In my original <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> post I had a secondary hypothesis where I talk about peak in satisfaction in smaller groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of &quot;team&quot; really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough &quot;attention&quot; is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is strong support for this in another plot found in the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">max subgraph size of guilds</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081231143011/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">Internet Archive</a>)</em> post where they compare the subgraph ration to guild sizes:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image013" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-500wi" title="Image013" /></a></p>
<p>Here you can see a strong peak at 10 people, that rapidly falls with guild size. This shows that guild cohesion is relatively easy to maintain up to size 10, but becomes much more difficult to maintain as guilds grow larger.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been saying for some time that studying online games is a valuable place to understanding social software. I&#39;m quite pleased that this research is proving this to be true.</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In yesterday's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2">All Things Considered</a>, NPR commentator <a href="http://jakehalpern.com/news.html">Jake Halpern</a> questions why you feel like you have a relationship with the characters in your favorite TV shows. His answer: &quot;That's because you do.&quot; This idea is interesting not just to help us understand how we relate to imaginary characters, but also to correlate with our own understanding of <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> relationship limits and how they might relate to this concept.</p>

<p>In his <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4772145">commentary</a>, Bostonian Jake Halpern considers two academic ideas, &quot;belongingness theory&quot; and &quot;para-social relationships&quot;, and how they affect the relationships we develop with television characters. He puts it all in the context of the 1990s TV show <em>Cheers</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/cheers.jpg" title="Cheers" alt="Cheers" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />&quot;My preoccupation with </em>Cheers the Bar<em> puzzled me until I stumbled upon a rather obscure but quite fascinating academic notion called </em>belongingness theory<em>.The argument goes something like this: in ancient times humans who stuck together increased the chances that they would survive and reproduce. So, when it came time to, say, hunt a large animal, or defend the cave against marauders, groups fared better then the guy on his own. In addition, adults in the group would have been more likely to find mates, reproduce, and raise their children. </em></p>

<p><em>The likely result of all this evolutionary selection is the creation of an internal mechanism that makes human beings crave social acceptance. The way I figured it, my irrational fondness for </em>Cheers the Bar<em> was just my belongingness mechanism kicking. I just wanted to be part of the gang.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Belongingness theory seems to have a good scientific basis. In <a href="http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/baumeist.dp.html">Baumeister</a> &amp; Leary's 1995 paper on Belongingness Theory, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;a mp;list_uids=7777651&amp;dopt=Abstract">The Need to Belong</a>, they stated that in order for belongingness to be considered a fundamental human motivation (as opposed to a want), it would have to be universal, affect a broad range of behaviors, lead to ill effects when thwarted, and elicit goal-oriented behavior designed to satisfy it. They found evidence for all of these. </p>

<p>Personally, I'm quite comfortable with the idea that evolution has encouraged us to have a number of &quot;social emotions&quot;, and that these may include a strong desire to belong.</p>

<p>Halpern continues in his commentary with a discussion of <em>para-social relationships</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;And this brings to yet another academic theory, that of </em>para-social relationships<em>. According to academics Horton and Wohl, who originated this concept, television gives viewers the &quot;illusion of a face-to-face relationship with the performer&quot;. Gradually over the course of many episodes, viewers come to feel that they '</em>know<em>' a persona.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>I totally buy it. After watching dozens of Cheers episodes, I felt as if I knew the personas in the show intimately. In fact there were times when I had seen more of the characters on Cheers then I seen of the people in my own family. So, yeah, I definitely had some para-social relationships going on.</em></p>

<p><em>The truth is, we all yearn for companionship. The only problem is, that for many of us, myself included, the notion of a well-functioning family and a welcoming group of friends and co-workers, is occasionally more easily found on television or in the movies, than in life itself.</em></p>

<p><em>After all, in order to maintain </em>'real'<em> relationships, you have to put in a tremendous amount of effort: making phone calls; returning emails; planning weekends together; etc. To maintain para-social relationships, however, all you have to do is flick on the TV.</em></p>

<p><em>If I'm being honest with myself, I have to admit that at times, Norm, Cliff, Carla, and Sam have formed, well, a kind of para-family to which I yearn to belong. I suppose that hideously hackneyed as it sounds, it's just like the show's theme song goes: </em>&quot;Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came.&quot;<em> Only, they <strong>don't</strong> know your name, and they really don't know you came.&quot;</em></p> </blockquote>

<p>Jake's description of Horton &amp; Wohl's theory on <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Modules/TF33120/horton_and_wohl_1956.html">para-social relationships</a> definitely parallels my thoughts in a previous post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar Triage: Too Many Connections</a> where I ask <em>&quot;How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?&quot;</em> As Jake said, it's difficult because you have to make the effort: the phone calls, the emails, meeting in person, and all the rest.</p> 

<p>However, the concept of having real relationships with television characters might give us enlightenment into some other relationship issues. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the mismatch between my number of connections and my own limits due to the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>; intuitively I feel that limiting my television watching can help. This is because these TV relationships are what I call &quot;junk relationships&quot;. Sometimes when I talk about the concept of the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>, I said that we may have difficulty even reaching the Dunbar limit of 150 people because of the &quot;junk relationships&quot; we maintain.</p>

<p>Does every ongoing para-social relationship with an ongoing series character, such as Cliff on Cheers or Kate on Lost, lower the number of relationships we can have with real people? I believe that this may be so.</p>

<p>And, if so, the answer to maintaining more connections with real people may be simply to turn off the television and tune in the real world instead.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my post about the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> I offered some evidence on the levels of satisfaction of various group sizes based on some empirical data from online games. There I was able to show that even though the Dunbar Number might predict a mean group size of 150 for humans, that in fact for non-survival oriented groups the mean was significantly less, probably between 60 to 90.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/groupsatisfaction.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=436,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="400" height="272" border="0" alt="Groupsatisfaction" title="Groupsatisfaction" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/groupsatisfaction.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
I also offered a second hypothesis, that there is a dip in satisfaction level of groups at around the size of 15. Unfortunately, I could only offer anecdotal evidence that this threshold existed. My personal belief was that this dip was caused by not enough &quot;attention&quot; being given to everyone and that group gatherings of this size risk becoming too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Yet groups of this size are not large enough to allow for different perspectives (i.e. insufficient <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REQVAR.html">requisite variety</a>) or for other group processes to come into play.</p>

<p>I was reading through the current (12 March) issue of <em>New Scientist</em>, and found an interesting table in the article <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18524901.600">Charity Begins at Homo Sapiens</a>. It stood out to me as it showed a dip approaching zero average cooperation for group sizes of 16 -- almost precisely same place that my hypothesis predicted.</p>

<p>Digging further, I found the original source for this table was published in <em>Nature</em> back in October 2003, in <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/papers/NatureOfHumanAltruism.pdf">The Nature of Human Altruism</a> written by <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/">Ernst Fehr</a> and <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fischbacher/">Urs Fischbacher</a>.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=495,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif"><img width="400" height="309" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif" title="Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1" alt="Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: left;" /></a>What the chart shows is actually not empirical data from human experiments, but instead data from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a> simulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>. This is the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum">zero-sum game</a> where if you cooperate, the joint payoff of the players is higher. However, in zero-sum games there is also incentive for the players to cheat by defecting and thus taking less risk. Robert Axelrod showed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465021212/102-0974708-1794504">The Evolution of Cooperation</a> back in 1985 that in spite of the statistical best individual strategy being that of defection, cooperation inevitably evolves.</p>

<p>Fehr and Fischbacher, in their <em>Nature</em> article, took this idea a bit further by creating 100 independent simulations with group sizes ranging from 2 to 512, and then executing each simulation 1,000 to 2,000 times. Each generation of the &quot;players&quot; was allowed to evolve different strategies of cooperation vs defection, the classic successful strategy being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat">Tit for Tat</a>. They would then evaluate the percentage of players who had cooperative strategies.</p>

<p>If punishment of defections was ruled out, they discovered that over the 1,000+ generations of the simulation that the rate of cooperation quickly crashes, such that at the group size of 8 a little over 50% cooperation evolved, and for groups that are larger than 16 none cooperate.</p>

<p>Next they added to the simulation &quot;<a name="altruistic_punishment">Altruistic Punishment</a>&quot;. This is the ability for players to punish those who did not cooperate -- however, such punishment is at some cost to the punisher. Earlier game theory <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/get_doc.pl?urn=RePEc:wpa:wuwpmi:0305006&amp;url=http://econwpa.wustl.edu:8089/eps/mic/papers/0305/0305006.pdf">research on altruistic punishment</a> has shown that cooperation flourishes if there is some price for punishing defectors -- if you allow punishment at no cost then cheating strategies emerge. This earlier research determined that allowing individuals to punish at some cost that yields them no material gain will paradoxically result in an average gain for everyone.</p>

<p>Adding altruistic punishment to the simulation increased the amount of cooperation that evolved, such that groups with the size of 32 would have 50% cooperation. But even this had limits; at the group size of 128 no cooperation would evolve.</p>

<p>Finally, if they added to the simulation the ability to punish those who did not participate in punishing (i.e. didn't pay the cost to punish defectors), then the percentage of cooperation that evolved was never less then 60%, and in fact got better as groups got larger.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting result. To explain it in different terms, if you have a system that depends on sharing some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">commons</a> and there are no process or trust metrics, a group as small as 16 may find themselves not cooperating very effectively.</p>

<p>The idea of commons can be as simple as how much speaking time participants in a meeting share. The time that each participant uses during the meeting can be considered the shared &quot;commons&quot;. If there are no enforced rules, with a group size of 16 there will inevitably be someone who will abuse the time and speak more than their share.</p>

<p>With some simple rules (some type of process to partition time more fairly), or through some trust metrics (punish those who abuse the commons), larger groups can gain value from cooperating, but even these groups have limits. As long as there is some effort required to punish those who abuse the process, eventually the price for that effort becomes too high, and no one is willing to punish any longer. You see this in moderated discussion groups, where the guardians of the common good have to spend too much time moderating, given the number of people that wish to participate. Moderated newsgroups and early versions of SlashDot moderation had this problem.</p>

<p>The most interesting observation from this simulation is that for larger groups, you needed to have a system to punish those who did not participate in punishing -- or to put it another way, get everyone involved with the process, not just a few. I think that this explains something that I've always wondered about SlashDot's <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MetaModeration">meta-moderation</a> system -- with this feature you grade those who have moderated, and if someone abuses it they will no longer be able to moderate. What I suspect, given these results, is that if you don't participate in the meta-moderation system, you have less a chance of being able to moderate; thus SlashDot has a system that punishes those who are not involved in participating.</p>

<p>I do have some questions based on this simulation -- I would like to see results with more granularity then powers of 2. I'd also like to know the percentage of players participating in punishment -- I suspect that you'll find a very small number of &quot;moderators&quot; are required in the middle graph, even when cooperation evolves successfully. I'm curious as to how many moderators are required to participate in punishing the non-punishers for cooperation to evolve in the third scenario. Also, in meta-moderation this simulation emphasizes punishing the non-punishers -- is that as successful as rewarding the punishers? I'm also interested in investigating some of the further works where Fehr and Fischbacher are among the co-authors, such as this <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/science/Altruistic_Punishment.pdf">study</a> using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) that shows that our brain's pleasure systems are activated when we altruistically punish.</p>

<p>I'm sure that the findings of this simulation are not the only reason why there might be a dip in group satisfaction at group sizes around 15, such as I observed. However, it does offer some interesting insights into group size thresholds, both for the threshold at 15 and for threshold of non-survival groups which I've identified as being significantly less then the Dunbar mean of 150. It also shows that for large groups we need to offer not only moderation, but meta-moderation capabilities that involve all the participants in the process.</p>

<p>In summary this research offers me another widget for my social software toolbox: in any group process look for the commons, allow participants to participate in identifing defectors; determine what the costs are for such identification (which may be as simple as requiring some attention or charging for such punishment); and encourage participation in the common good by punishing those who do not participate in seeking out defectors.</p>

<p>As someone who now has over 171 professional &quot;connections&quot; in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn Profile</a>, 198 &quot;friends&quot; on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a>, many more non-intersecting friends and acquaintances on&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.Net</a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/christophera_/">LiveJournal</a>, and <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/sns-meta-list/">other social networking services</a>, as well as a plethora of correspondents that I only interact with via email, I am trying reconcile a mismatch between my connections and my own <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?</p>

<p>Venture Capitalist <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/02/quality_or_quan.html">Jeff Nolan</a> relates similar concerns:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
&quot;It strikes me that the social networking theory holds that the more volume you have, the bigger your network will become by introducing degrees of separation roughly along the lines of Metcalfe's Law. I disagree, human networks do not grow in value by multiplying, but rather by reduction. For me, it's the quality of relationships that enhances my professional and personal life, not the sheer numbers.&quot;
</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately social networking services -- be it LinkedIn, Tribe.Net, Orkut, or LiveJournal -- are making the problem worse, not solving it. Any engineer or information theorist can tell you that a system that only has amplifiers will be out of balance, and that you need attenuators in the system as well. Our current breed of social networking services have focused on amplifying our contacts not only because it serves us, but because it serves them. The more contacts that you make, the more people they potentially have in their service. However, in the long run this is unsustainable -- a social networking service also has to be useful -- merely amplifying your contacts isn't enough.</p>

<p>Thus the problem becomes not just one unique to me, where my friends network is overextended, but rather one that's endemic to the current generation of social networking services. In order to solve it we need to look at the traditional cultural answers to the problem, compare them to technical solutions, both current and to-be-invented, and then see how a new generation of social networking services can be designed that molds the two ideas together into a more cohesive whole.</p>

<p>I offer here the beginning of that discussion.</p>

<h4>The Cultural Strategies</h4>

<p>The problem of overextended social networks are not new with the Internet generation. Many professions require maintaining a large base of relationships and have done so for hundreds of years, among them: politicians, salespeople, public company CEOs, and even professions that you might not think of requiring these skills such as family doctors. The Dunbar Number of 150 may be a kind of species-wide average limit, it is not an individual limit -- thus my guess is that people with an innate talent for maintaining more relationships are attracted to these professions. But even with innate talent those who follow these professions can be overwhelmed, and each have found different cultural strategies for managing larger numbers of relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Spending More Time:</strong> Some people just spend a lot more time keeping up with their connections. Politicians and salespeople are classic examples of professions that require significant schmoozing time in order to keep trusted connections together.</p>

<p>How does someone like a member of the US House of Representatives manage their relationships? In no way can they even come close to having a relationship with all the 645,952 people they represent. They would, however, at least have to keep up at some level with the other 435 House members, their own staff, key members of the staff of other House members, as well as key politicians and contacts back home. From what I've read, successful politicians spend most of their days just meeting with people, and have staff dedicated to &quot;tickling&quot; -- keeping track of constituents, schedules, issues, etc. and reminding the politician before each meeting of the essentials they need to know.</p>

<p>The cost of this strategy is twofold -- the time spent managing relationships can't be spent elsewhere, and the quantity of relationships lowers the quality of those relationships. For instance, my experience with most politicians and many salesperson is that I will be forgotten as soon as I leave the room.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Changing the Standard:</strong> There are different cultural standards in each profession as to what is an acceptable relationship. Thus some people chooose a profession that manages relationships in different ways. Doctors are a good example of socializers who fit into this category.</p>

<p>Your family doctor has a similar problem to that of politicians -- too many people to keep track of. Yet a good family practitioner can see you and look beyond just today's symptoms. Thus because of an ongoing relationship with you he can be a better doctor.</p>

<p>The way the doctor does this is through cultural and professional limits. Because of the authority, status and title granted to doctors, patients tend to defer to them. There is not an expectation that the relationship is equal. This allows the doctor to have a 'shallower' relationship with the patient that is still acceptable.</p>

<p>Still, even this level of serial, shallow socialization can be excessive for many people. A Radiologist acquaintance of mine told me the reason why she ended up in her specialty was that she just couldn't handle the ongoing patient relationships required by other specialities -- instead, she now looks at one set of images at a time, performs a diagnosis, and doesn't have to retain any relationship to move on to the next patient.</p>

<p>There are also problems with changing your socialization standards. Unless it is culturally understood, or your standard is reciprocated by others, it can make you appear shallow and not trustworthy. I've seen this when someone moves from one profession to another, say a salesperson to a manager -- styles of relationships that were acceptable among salesperson and between salespeople and customers are not quite as acceptable as those between managers and their staff. Another example is when someone moves from the East Coast to the West Coast, where the usefulness of casual alumni connections is significantly less valued, but those casual connections are unable to understand the change in standards.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Prioritization:</strong> Perhaps a more common cultural strategy for managing excessive relationships is prioritization. I could prioritize my relationships and focus only on the 100+ or so that might be the most useful to me.</p>

<p>There are two problems with prioritizing. First, analyses of social networks show that it is often the weak and most unrelated links that can be <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1333462/0">the most important</a>. Thus any attempt to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage">triage</a> may cut off some of these weak ties because I thought that the links might not be &quot;useful&quot;.</p>

<p>Secondly, how do you tell someone &quot;I'm sorry, but I'm overly Dunbarred, so I have removed you from my list.&quot; Rejection is painful (as <a href="http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/mripain01.htm">MRI brain studies</a> have actually shown), so I risk offending people forever by excluding them today.</p>

<h4>The Technological Solutions</h4>

<p>One of the great hopes of social networking services is to improve the ways that we interact with other people, particularly those that we know at a distance -- the &quot;weak links&quot;. Right now, these services are part of the problem because they offer out-of-balance social systems. However, they can also be part of the solution; science-fiction writers and social software designers alike are starting to look at these issues and offer new solutions that would not have been possible before the advent of widespread software communication systems.</p>

<p><strong>Technological Solution - Augmentation:</strong> <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/geodesica.jpg" title="Geodesica" alt="Geodesica" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />I recently read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a>, a new science fiction novel by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, a futurist example of augmentation as a method of maintaining extended social networks.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a> the protagonist, &quot;Melilah&quot; is a politician in the distant future. She has her own problems with the Dunbar Number, and solves it with her own personalized social networking service:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Two things she had learned from her political career were that society depended on interpersonal relationship networks, and that everything could turn on a simple misidentification. In her fifties she had set about ensuring that her memory remained in good working order in order to avoid the latter. Anthropologists had known since the twentieth century that people were born with a ceiling on their social groups. Once Melilah exceeded the Dunbar and Hill number of 150, and rapidly acquiring still more associates, it became progressively harder to keep track of everyone she had to know. As she passed her hundredth birthday, it became only worse. Some of her contemporaries option for cortical grafts and other memory prosthetics. She, motivated by a gut-level -- some would say irrational -- desire to keep her body as free of technology as possible, opted for other means.</em></p>

<p><em>She had found that using a name once every two months was enough to keep her memory fresh. Any longer than that between reminders, and the associations faded, rendering recall unreliable. So she programmed a complete list of her occasional acquaintances and enemies into a database and programmed it to cycle through them ever sixty days, shuffling the order each time.</em></p>

<p><em>A hundred years on, she was still in the habit of skimming fifty or so names a day, just to keep on the ball. By flicking through the images, voice files, place names, and more obtuse clues, she felt confident of recognizing any of the several thousand people more or less likely to interact with her at any point in the near future. The list had grown and shrunk down over the years, and many people had dropped off it entirely because of death or distance. Sometimes she added names to the list only to be surprised that they had been on it once before, decades ago, and she had forgotten them completely. That only reinforced the need for the list and the effort to keep it fresh in her mind.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure that the Dunbar Number problem is solely one of &quot;recognition&quot;, as illustrated by Williams and Dix. However, I think this is a great example of seeing how a traditional cultural solution to network overextension (namely, &quot;Spending More Time&quot;) can be better applied by Social Software. In this example Melilah's software automates the &quot;ticklers&quot; that politicians use.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/spokekeepintouchsettings.gif" title="Spokekeepintouchsettings" alt="Spokekeepintouchsettings" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: right;" />Already at least one social networking service has adopted a somewhat similar idea.
<a href="http://center.spoke.com/person/personalProfileTab.spoke?id=[serverID=center,ID=4877427]">Spoke</a> has a &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; setting. The Spoke client software will watch your Outlook mailbox and addressbook to see how often you contact various people, and if you don't email them or modify your address book entry for them periodically, will remind you that you should contact them.</p>

<p>I've never used Spoke's &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; feature -- largely for privacy reasons (I was <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html">stung by a Zero Degrees</a> Outlook extension), but also because Spoke seemed to be oriented toward salespeople and thus emphasized growing the network. My problem is not growing my network, but managing the network I already have more effectively. But I may have to take another look at Spoke. So, it doesn't quite offer the same solution that Melilah used in the far-future, but it's still a start upon that path.</p>

<h4>Conclusions and Questions</h4>

<p>I'm not certain that Spoke's &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; feature, or Melilah's social recognition reminder service are the full solution to the &quot;Dunbar Triage&quot; problem. However, they do at least offer a few examples of people looking at the problems, and how social software can help solve them.</p>

<p>As I've outlined here there are at least three traditional methods&nbsp; that we've used to manage Dunbar Triage prior to advent of social networking services: spending more time, changing standards, and prioritization. The technological solutions that I've offered up as an example concentrates upon the first of those cultural solutions, but it is by no means a conclusive statement on the issue.</p>

<p>How could next-generation social networking services improve upon the ideas of changing standards or prioritization? Could simple categorization help improve expectations for attention levels that various associates receive from you? Are there ways that social networking services, acting as an intermediary, could better manage disappointment-inducing events, such as a decision to spend less attention on an associate?</p>

<p>More so, could social software offer solutions that aren't even being considered right now? For example, many Cyberpunk novels have suggested the ideas of avatars that can collect information for you on the 'net while your attention is elsewhere. Could these avatars likewise maintain more distant social networks for you, without your full attention? Would that function even be desirable?</p>

<p>Some solutions are not technological -- what new skills and changes to practices, etiquette and ethics are required for our ever expanding network of relationships? Or as <a href="http://alevin.com/weblog/">Adina</a> asks: <em>&quot;Who will offer us a 21st century, internet-augmented take on Dale Carnegie and Emily Post?&quot;</em></p>

<p>As with any problem in the developing technical world, the first step is to define the problem and to consider possible solutions. Here's the start: social networks can become too large, and many social networking services are causing the problem rather than solving it.</p>

<p>What's your solution?</p>
