					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/committing_to_v.html">Committing to Vonage</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">
                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In September I signed up for <a href="http://www.vonage.com">Vonage</a>, a VoIP (Voice-over-IP) service that using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) that allows you to connect using the net to the analog POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) quite economically.</p>

<p>I've had for a while a Cisco VoIP phone that is connected to the <a href="http://www.pch.net/">PCH</a> (Packet Clearing House) experimental <a href="http://www.pch.net/inoc-dba/">INOC-DBA Phone Hotline</a>. This is a private telephone network for the internet that directly connects to internet operators and sysadmins at various ISPs and hosting sites, allowing them to communicate and share problems. I've been very pleased with the quality of the connections -- if anything, better then POTS in most cases.</p>

<p>Given the quality of the Cisco VoIP phone, I thought it worth investigating to see if I could justify a VoIP system for Alacrity and closely related companies like Skotos, but discovered that hosting our own Cisco-based system would probably be too expensive. Then I heard about Vonage.</p>

<p>Vonage offers unlimited local and regional calling and 500 minutes of US/Canada calling for $24.99 a month -- however, in addition to this I get complete "class 5" telephone services, which includes voice mail (which can be emailed to you), call forwarding, caller ID, etc. -- with my local service SBC/PacBell I was paying over $44 a month just for services, not any calling charges. Just the voice mail forwarding to my email is almost worth the price that I'm paying for the line.</p>

<p>When I initially investigated I was concerned what would happen if my net connection was down, and was pleased to find that they have a feature such that if the net connection was down the phone would forward to another line. This could be an analog land line or to a cell phone.</p>

<p>My other reservation was that Vonage would not work with my existing Cisco VoIP phone -- instead they send you a dedicated Cisco box that you then attach your normal analog POTS phone to. I can understand why they do this -- having only one kind of hardware to deal with makes tech support easier, and allowing people to use their existing POTS phones would make it easier for unsophisticated customers.</p>

<p>I decided to experiment by transfering one of my business lines -- I have moved my office in Berkeley to a home office in Kensington, and I've been paying $0.01 a minute to transfer calls as SBC/PacBell would not let me move the phone line here. So I was paying for 2 lines, one in Berkeley and one in Kensington plus $0.01 minute, so obviously switching to Vonage would save me money.</p>

<p>I had the Vonage working in a couple of days -- I just have it down in my machine room connected to my ethernet switch, and from there connected to my regular building analog phone wires. It worked great, but my pre-existing number was not working with it yet, just a temporary number from Vonage. Several months later the number was finally transferred -- not Vonage's fault, but SBC/PacBell's, who made it very difficult to transfer.</p>

<p>Now that it is all installed I'm finding it quite convenient. Also, I'm finding has some long-term advantages. If I go for an extended trip, and if I have a net connection, I can just bring the small Cisco box and a phone with me and I can call and answer my own phone line wherever I may be. I can even go overseas and my US telephone number can still work. While I'm disconnected, Vonage will forward my calls to my cell phone.</p>

<p>I'm going to keep trying it for a few more months, and it continues to have the quality that I need, I will probably move all but one emergency unlisted analog phone line to Vonage. That is all my lines - fax, home, business, etc. This will give me the ultimate in portability.</p>

<p>They also now have for existing customers a "soft" VoIP client that works on your computer or laptop. I may try that soon as well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in trying out Vonage, they have a special offer where if I refer you they'll give us both 1 free month of service. I have to send you an email to trigger it, so if you are interested send me an email.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I've been playing around with a number of so-called Social Software/Social Networking sites for about six months.</p>

<p>I'm currently on <a href="http://new.ryze.com/view.php?who=ChristopherA">Ryze</a> with supposedly 13 'Friends' and 414 in 'Network', and <a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub%2Cpcard%2CBasics.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.net</a> with 20 'Friends' and 17,677 in my 'Network'. I've registered for a few others, but wasn't able to get them going much beyond registering. However, I have not registered for Friendster yet, as it was originally a dating site but I understand now that it is more then that.</p>

<p>These Social Networking sites have been interesting, but so far none have been a really useful to me.  </p>

<p>I've identified a few problems:</p>

<p><li>Getting started can be difficult -- you have to either invite a bunch of your own friends (which can be tacky) or you have to find an acquaintance who is has already collected a number of people as their friends and join with them.</p>

<p><li>You also have to be faithful to updating your local home page, and I for one have too many home pages.</p>

<p><li>There seems to be some cache to have lots of network 'Friends', however, I'm really uncomfortable with that. There is often a 'tit-for-tat' that goes on that is "I'll add you as a friend if you'll add me". But I'd rather name them something different then a friend. In fact, a number of people that I have as 'Friends' are people that I'd rather name as 'Aquaintances', as maybe I've met them once or twice in person, typically at an event where we didn't have any in-depth interaction.</p>

<p><li>Last, but probably most important -- I'm not getting enough value from them for the effort. I do have a friend that say that she has gotten good business from it, but I think that is more because she is a single woman and because she attended some live events sponsored by the social network. Maybe my problem is that I'm a decent networker by myself, and don't need the extra help of the service?</p>

<p>All that I've joined feel just a bit off -- but yet I still believe there is something useful in Social Software to learn that I just have to puzzle out.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.henshall.com/blog/">Stuart Henshal</a> recommended that I try out <a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.Bloggar</a> for creating blog posts. I'm giving it a try here.</p>

<p>So far seems interesting -- in addition to spell checking and handling some html related tasks, it appears to also have the ability to work with various plugins, for instance, a Windows Media Player plugin to display what music I'm playing right now.</p>

<p> <div class="media">[Listening to: Crimson (4-4) - Solace - Ahsas (04:15)]</div><br />
Stuart says that one of his favorite features is that the tool will post to multiple blogs at once, which is useful if you are maintaining a business and a non-business blog and yet some items will go into both.</p>

				<p>As a user-interface designer in the 80's for companies like Apple Computer, and as old 'groupware' professional in the early 90's, I've been quite disappointed with how design of collaborative apps appears to have practically ceased since the introduction of the web.</p>

<p>It is not that there haven't been lots of new features added in the last 10 years, it is that they are often too complex, or are pure eye-candy and not particular useful. I'm a believer in elegance and I've not seen much of it lately.</p>

<p>However, I saw in in Slashdot today that IBM has some web pages demonstrating a <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/index.html">prototype email client</a> which I find quite elegant at first glance.</p>

<p>I hope some people like the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/">Evolution</a> team, or the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> team, or some new entrepreneur make available.</p>

				<p>I'm fascinated by the melding of various ethic music styles with contemporary music, in particular, when the mix includes some middle-eastern or central-european infuences.</p>

<p>For instance, listen to these:</p>

<p><li> A mix of rock and middle-eastern: <a href="http://he1.magnatune.com/all/01%20-%20Too%20tight%20-%20Falik.mp3">Too Tight</a> by <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/artists/falik">Falik</a> on their album <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/artists/music/World/Falik/Streaks%20and%20Strokes/">Streaks and Strokes</a><br/><font size=-2>(stream complements of  by the "We are not Evil" <a href="http://www.magnatune.com">MagnaTune</a>).</font></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A very interesting <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/level2.cfm?resource=musicrisk1">article</a> that has a different take on why the tussle of people who file share vs. the Music Industry. What I like is that it is taking a "behavioral economics" approach to understanding the problem.<br />
<b><a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/level2.cfm?resource=musicrisk1"> <br />
The New Economics of Music: File-Sharing and Double Moral Hazard</a></b><br />
<blockquote>Every major label 's setting up an iTunes these days. They're all, in the immortal words of Johnny Cash, 'born to lose, and destined to fail'. Why? The music industry doesn't understand the microeconomics of it's own business. If it did, it would see that it's business model is not just misguided, but broken--because, DRM or not, the implicit contract it signs with listeners is being broken in both directions.</blockquote><br />
The key paragraph in this article is:</p>

<blockquote>The point is this: the net offers listeners insurance against the music industry itself. File-sharing isn't simply theft. Rather, file-sharing is risk-sharing - against an industry with the freedom to undertake hidden action in the extreme, and not live up to the contract it has written. Remember, the contract said that labels would assume the risk in exchange for dollars from listeners - so when moral hazard lets labels try and push risk to listeners, is it any surprise that listeners try and minimize it by parceling it out? In fact, we could go even further - saying that file-sharing is a way for principals to punish agents operating under extreme moral hazard, with the hope of bringing the agents incentives into line. </blockquote>

				<p>I have been experimenting with <a href="http://www.elance.com">eLance</a>, which is a source of contractors for various web, graphic, and business related projects. So far I've put out bids for 4 projects, ranging from web programming with PHP, to graphics, and business competitive research. I've been amazed at the number of and quality of the bids I've been getting, as well as extremely reasonable prices for small project. I have my doubts regarding this system for big projects, but for well defined projects of under $5-10K, so far I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>A social issue, however, when many of the best bids and prices come from overseas -- what is better, 'buy american' or 'support the world economy'?</p>

				<p>I have been working on some code for experimenting with some of my ideas regarding the future of wiki's, at <a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net">EditThisPagePHP</a> which is hosted at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.</p>

<p>At this point it is just a trivial application -- it just lets you edit remotely a single page. I'm trying to slowly add in elegant features without compromising on this projects essential simplicity. Longer term goals are focused around trying to figure out better solutions for the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RefactoringWikiPages">RefactoringWiki Problem</a>, which might include such future features as proposals, voting, different commenting techniques, different versioning, etc. There is no specific commercial goal with this project, it is open source.</p>
