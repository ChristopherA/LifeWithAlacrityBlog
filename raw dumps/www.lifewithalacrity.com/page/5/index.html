			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5c52eae970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Creative-commons-non-commercial" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5c52eae970c " src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5c52eae970c-120pi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Creative-commons-non-commercial" /></a> Last year I participated in a survey followed up by a focus group on the topic of Noncommercial Use, in particular around the context that about 2/3rds of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses extant use the NC attribute, such as in&#0160;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC-BY-NC</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Defining &quot;Noncommercial&quot;: &#0160;A Study of how the Online Population Understands &quot;Noncommercial&quot; Use</strong><br /><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Defining_Noncommercial" style="color: #2a5db0; " target="_blank">http://wiki.<wbr />creativecommons.org/Defining_<wbr />Noncommercial</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The topic is somewhat of a sticky one, as there are many competing interests. There are content creators who wish to profit from their work, there are other content creators who don&#39;t want anyone to profit (even themselves), and of course there are content creators who want everything to be free provided you share free content back.</p>

<p>There also is not agreement on what noncommerical means. There are some clearly commercial uses, but there are also various type advertising and sponsorship and use by non-profit or education institutions where money changes hands (such as a card at a museum gift shop). Finally, there is use in news or criticism where users feel that they are not restricted due to the rules of fair-use.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that there is anything definitely &quot;new&quot; in this report, but there is some consensus and some interesting facts:</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The vast majority (73%) of creators define “commercial use” as a&#0160;use where money is made, 76% of content users agreed.</li>
<li>33% of content users thought that individual use was&#0160;noncommercial use, whereas only 19% of the content creators&#0160;believed so.</li>
<li>Content creators rate uses by individuals as being less&#0160;commercial (89%) – unless the user is a professional who earns&#0160;money (35%)</li>
<li>13% of content users thought that fun, enjoyment, entertainment&#0160;and artistic use was noncommercial use, whereas only 3% of&#0160;content creators believed so.</li>
<li>52% of the content creators don&#39;t believe that content users&#0160;understand the noncommercial provision, and 43% believe that&#0160;content users don&#39;t respect the term.</li>
<li>50% of the content creators have been contacted about licensing&#0160;their noncommercial content, 24% of the content creators have&#0160;attempted to contact another creator about appropriate use of a&#0160;CC license.</li>
<li>There is a lack of agreement on a lot of edge cases of&#0160;noncommercial use. For instance, some feel cost-recovery is&#0160;acceptable noncommercial use, money exchanged hands for a&#0160;charitable use would be noncommercial, or use by a for-profit&#0160;company where no money changed hands would still be noncommercial.</li>
<li>There is some interesting analysis of what people might be&#0160;willing to change their mind about. For instance, before focus&#0160;group participation only 8% thought that use for charitable&#0160;purposes for social good would be noncommercial, but after the&#0160;focus group 17% did.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all an excellent report, with lots of good data in it for further investigation. If you are involved in user-generated content, offer users creative-commons licenses, or are a consumer or provider of commercial content online, I recommend you take the time to understand these issues more deeply.</p>

<p>My personal take on this report is that the noncommercial provisions of the CC license need more clarification and there needs to be more user education. In addition I feel that Creative Commons also needs to look at the commercial use side of the problem. I appreciate the recent efforts toward a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC Plus</a> metadata, but it isn&#39;t enough.

</p>

<p><a class="image" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/File:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png" title="Image:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png"><img alt="Image:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png" border="0" height="31" src="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/4/49/Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png" width="88" /></a> <span style="font-size: 280%">+</span> <a class="image" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/File:Commercial-license-button.png" title="Image:Commercial-license-button.png"><img alt="Image:Commercial-license-button.png" border="0" height="31" src="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/9/91/Commercial-license-button.png" width="88" /></a></p> 

For instance Creative Commons should take a principled stand on what exactly &quot;fair use&quot; is; make it easier for those who offer NC licenses to also offer a standard commercial license for common uses; and possibly creating a standard for what &quot;fair rights&quot; are in commercial license (i.e. fair to both the content creator and the content user).<p></p>

<p>There are also problems in the area of attribution, as all Creative Commons licenses except Public Domain have the BY provision. These get particularly difficult when you have a remix of content from many creators. There&#39;s also difficulty in the fact that it&#39;s not stated what places attribution must be listed in. For instance, can you do a movie or a podcast with remixed content, but have the attribution credits be a link? Or must they be credits in the media itself?</p><p>All are interesting problems that I hope Creative Commons will address in the future.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">my first article</a>&#0160;in this series I talked about community numbers: how the sizes of groups ultimately affect their success (or failure). However what I discussed only offers up the most rudimentary explanation of the dynamics, and that is because typically not all of the members of a group are equally involved.</p>

<p>In order to better define <em>who</em> constitutes the tightly-knit &quot;participant community&quot; upon which the group thresholds act, we have to study power laws which let us measure the intensity of individuals&#39; involvement in a group.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Power Laws</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366611997/" title="Pareto Principle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Pareto Principle" height="179" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3616/3366611997_95f255e4a3_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>The best-known power law is probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>, which is otherwise known as the &quot;80/20 law.&quot; It&#39;s been overused throughout the years; Pareto&#39;s actual law only said that 80% of the wealth would be held by 20% of the population.</p>

<p>However, it offers a fine example of how power laws work. They generally describe a discrepancy between intensity and population: inevitably, some people do a lot more of the work in any social situation. Other examples include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf&#39;s Law</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367563212/" title="Long Tail Curve by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img height="174" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3603/3367563212_8aa7a62c6f_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>which suggests that the frequency of a word&#39;s usage is inversely proportionate to its ranking among words (making the second ranked word appear half as much, the third a quarter as much, etc), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">long tail</a>, which talks about selling a very large number of items in a very small individual quantity.</p>

<p>For online communities, which have been the focus of most of my studies on the topic of community sizes, I&#39;ve found that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_inequality">participation inequality</a> power rule is very apt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366764093/" title="Participation Inequality by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality" height="192" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3613/3366764093_29495ce5b4_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>This term comes from Will Hill of AT&amp;T Laboratories, who said, &quot;A major reason why user-contributed content rarely turns into a true community is that all aspects of Internet use are characterized by severe participation inequality.&quot; It&#39;s often equated with the 1% law, though I like to be more precise and say that 90% of an online community tends to be lurkers, 9% tends to be intermittent participants, and 1% tends to be active participants.</p>

<p>These values heavily influence online community sizes that are larger than the tightly-knit communities group thresholds that I previously discussed.</p>

<h3>Power Laws &amp; Group Thresholds</h3>

<p>When I wrote about tightly-knit communities in my first article, I didn&#39;t consider the degree of participation. That&#39;s certainly an entirely valid model for some types of groups. Corporations, for example, ideally should be entirely filled with active participants, while Skotos&#39; online game <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/">Castle Marrach</a> also fits into the category due to the implicit requirements it creates for participation. There are some challenges to grow this type of community, since you&#39;re only searching for a specific type of high-energy participant — but they can be overcome if you offer sufficient incentive (such as a salary or a lot of internal feedback).</p>

<p>However, most communities, and in particular, online communities, will not fall into this category, and thus when we&#39;re looking at group thresholds, we have to measure them against the number of <em>active participants</em>, not against the number of total members. Thus, for groups which allow for non-participation, we&#39;ll often measure 10% (or maybe 1%) of the group size against the group thresholds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpg.net">RPGnet</a>, one of the community sites that Skotos runs, offers a good example of this. We regularly see monthly uniques of approximately 200,000 users. However we probably have about 20,000 active registered users, confirming the lurker:participant ratio. When we recognize that only 2,000 of those are particularly active participants and that they&#39;re divided upon 6 successful forums, we start to see how community numbers that actually match the group thresholds can gel.</p>

<p>You can reverse this approach and look at active participants first. During some recent consulting for a local non-profit organization with 60 active online members, I was able to infer that their broader community was around 6000, which turned out to fairly accurately predict the total number of people who came to their live events over the course of a year.</p>

<p>Generally, this logic can be applied to a community of any size. You first measure whether it&#39;s an all-participant community or one that matches an existing power law, and then you use the corrected community number to truly measure which of the group thresholds may apply to it.</p>

<h3>Power Laws &amp; Leaders</h3>

<p>The power laws can also help you to measure the number of leaders in a community. Inevitably all of your participants will become leaders of some sort, while your high-level participants will become the top-tier leaders.</p>

<p>I noted this in my first discussions of group threshold. In a group of 7 members, you can reasonably expect to have one higher level participant, and thus the one leader that we saw naturally appear. Similarly in a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number">Judas group of 13</a>, there&#39;s the opportunity for more than one leader to appear, creating the possibility for the first hierarchical conflicts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609602/" title="Participation Inequality 90 9 1 by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality 90 9 1" height="153" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3367609602_4445e5cfb9_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>Understanding your count of leaders can help you see how to grow groups. For example when I first created <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com">iPhoneWebDev</a> I had to do an immense amount of effort to grow the community. This is because with Participation Inequality I had to grow the group by 10 members before I got the least amount of help increasing the content of the group and I had to grow it by 100 members before I had someone who was doing as much work as I was to create content.</p>

<p>At 100 members, with my first active participant, we continued to grow, but we were both were working hard and felt rather lonely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366786135/" title="Participation Inequality 700 70 7 by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality 700 70 7" height="196" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3366786135_53f8ebcf47_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>I finally saw the group stabilize, then take off on its own, when it hit 600-700 members, and that shows how beautifully the power logs work hand-in-hand with the group thresholds. With 700 members, I could reasonably expect there to be 7 leaders. In other words, I had a committee of leaders: the perfect size for a starting&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Working_Group">working group</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>From my experience with other online groups, if the iPhoneWebDev grows to over 10,000 members, I can expect that there will be some transition issues. As the core active community members exceed 100 people I will start having some <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number">Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number</a> problems, typically social contract failures. These can be solved by either adding some hierarchy (appointing some people to be official &quot;staff&quot;), or by starting to break the group into sub-communities.</p>

<h3>Varying the Power Laws</h3>

<p>In my first article, I noted that it&#39;s possible to expend additional energy to make tightly-knit groups able to function effectively at non-optimal sizes. It is similarly possible for the values of the participation inequality sized groups to change by expending more energy. Conversely, a drain on energy&#0160;may decrease this ratio.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609374/" title="Participation Inequality - High Energy by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality - High Energy" height="169" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3367609374_3975fe9bf7_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>For example when I used to run AOL forums I would frequently reward first-time participants with free time (at that time worth $5 an hour) if they asked good questions or offered valuable input. CompuServe similarly offered constructive feedback by telling users how many responses they&#39;d received to a new comment when they logged back in, encouraging them to leave lurker status. More energy in the community — driven either by the moderators, good social software design, or by a greater commitment by its members — can allow you to increase the active participant percentage, maybe times 2, or even 4, but even with a lot of effort not by an order of magnitude.</p><p>As a group grows in size, I believe the participation inequality worsens. A huge Yahoo! group with a million members might have moved from a 90/9/1 ratio to 95/4.5/.5. I suspect this is because the energy required to change the participation inequality numbers is so large as to not be economical.</p>

<p>There are also some interesting interrelations between the numbers of people at the various levels of participation. Though discovering 100 new members has a good chance of adding 10 new participants, 1 of whom is very active, my experience has been that things trickle-down in the other direction as well: that adding 1 new high-level participant can lead to the creation of 9 medium-level participants and 90 lurkers (though don&#39;t let that suggest that all of your effort should be expended on the high-level participants only).</p>

<h3>Looking at Participation Inequality</h3>

<p>Here is a close look at four online communities, using the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/">quantcast.com</a> metrics service, where you can see some participation inequality in action:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609306/" title="Participation Inequality - quantcast.com by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality - quantcast.com" height="235" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3367609306_023c85652f_o.jpg" width="961" /></a>

</p><p>From this you can see a typical online community site shows the normal 90% 9% 1% participation inequality. RPGnet shows a slightly better then average participation inequality due to its longevity and the quality of the community. ObesityHealth shows evidence of a great community with its 4% active participants, probably because you have to be very committed if you are going to have bariatric surgery. Last, an example of relatively&#0160;unhealthy&#0160;community that is unable to sustain its active participants.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful when analyzing quantcast numbers if you see active participants of greater then 6% — in almost all cases if you look deeper it is because there is some restriction that keeps people from lurking, either a fee or some other type of gateway, causing a distortion in the statistics.

</p><h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Multiple factors influence the success (or failure) or community. As we saw in my&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">first article</a>&#0160;on community numbers, the first factor is the&#0160;differing&#0160;group thresholds of community sizes. In my&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">second article</a>, I show that&#0160;personal limits on the number of people you can have intimacy and trust with is an important factor. In this article I show that larger groups are subject to the power law of participation inequality, causing a small fraction of a community to be subject to group thresholds. In all three articles I show how expending energy can allow you to change the numbers, but with limits.</p><p>I hope this discussion of community numbers will give you some tools to look at the communities you are in, or are trying to build, and to better understand how to make them more successful.</p>

				<p>In my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">previous</a> post, I talked about the limits on sizes of tightly-knit communities. These group limits are closely related to a number of interesting personal limits, and are often confused with them.</p>

<p>Unlike the group limits, personal limits actually measure something different: the number of connections that an individual can hold. They're yet another thing that you must consider when thinking about communities of people.</p>

<h3>Personal Limits</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3054773873/" title="Support Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3183/3054773873_07514d66dc_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Support Circle" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"/></a><strong>The Support Circle:</strong> This is the number of individuals that you seek advice, support, or help from in times of severe emotional or financial stress. In most societies, the average size of an individual's Support Circle is 3-5. The people are the core of your intimate social network and most typically are also kin. In sociology papers this is often called the &quot;support clique&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563324/" title="Sympathy Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3055563324_f62dbcdc7d_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Sympathy Circle" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a><strong>The Sympathy Circle</strong>: This is larger then the Support Circle — it is the number of people that you go to for sympathy and also those people whose death would be devastating to you. The Sympathy Circle typically is in the range of 10-15 people, but can vary widely from as few as 7 to as many as 20. The Sympathy Circle often may be made up of kin, but usually includes some peers as well.</p>

<p>In sociology papers the Sympathy Circle is also known as a &quot;sympathy group&quot;, but I wanted to avoid the term &quot;group&quot;, as it is implies that all the members of a Sympathy Circle are connected. Instead, members of your Sympathy Circle will have additional people in their own Sympathy Circles that are not part of your own.</p>

<p>An interesting issue with the Sympathy Circle is that as a personal limit, 10-15 is a typical size. however, if you bring them all together in one place, they will likely become a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number">Judas-Number-sized group</a>, with all of the problems associated with that size.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563798/" title="Trust Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3055563798_5355b9b99c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Trust Circle" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a><strong>The Trust Circle</strong>: These are the people that you have some type of intimate connection to. One study measured it as the people that you would send a family Christmas card to, while another simply tested emotional closeness.</p>

<p>In pre-Friendster days the Trust Circle would be those people that you considered your &quot;friends&quot;, however today the meaning of that term has begun to change. In my own usage, your Trust Circle are people that you have strong ties to and that in some measure you can trust. I have also called the Trust Circle your personal "intimate social network".</p>

<p>The size of different individuals' Trust Circles can vary widely (40-200), but <a href="http://delicious.com/christophera/trustcircle">some studies</a> show that the mean is on the low side of 150. This has led a number of researchers to compare this number with the Exclusive Dunbar Number of 150. However, I believe that this is a mistake; they are related, but in today's society members of your Trust Circle are rarely in the same mutual group.</p>

<p><strong>The Emotional Circle</strong></p>

<p> I personally define your Emotional Circle as the total number of people that you can have some type of non-mutual emotional connection with, most likely spread across numerous groups of all sorts. You &quot;like&quot; them in some way, but do not necessarily have to have strong ties to them.</p>

<p>In academia this threshold is called &quot;social channel capacity&quot;. A <a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/channel+capacity+christophermccarty">study</a> using two different methods to estimate, both suggest that it falls right around 290. However, I like to describe this number as &quot;just short of 300.&quot; As I wrote in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar Triage</a>, many people confuse this number with the Dunbar Number (and in fact I have in some of my older pieces). However, like the Trust Circle, it's a distinct entity.</p>

<p>Emotional Circle size can vary quite a bit from individual to individual. Some people might have half the average capacity, and others considerably more — which is much more variation than you see among the sizes of smaller personal thresholds.</p>

<p>Some of those variations are individual, but some are societal. As I wrote in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/07/cheers_belongin.html">Cheers: Belongingness and Para-Social Relationships</a>, I believe that our modern era of television causes us to create para-social relationships with imaginary characters who we nonetheless become emotionally involved with, and thus might reduce our social channel capacity.</p>

<p>Is our Emotional Circle smaller today because of TV or is it higher because online communities can help to remind us of our emotional connections to other people? That's a topic that probably deserves more study.</p>

<p>An interesting point to make is that the people who are in your Emotional Circle, but are not in your Trust Circle, are your &quot;weak ties&quot; in social network terms. What is important about weak ties is that <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/225469">studies show</a> (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf">pdf</a>) that opportunities and knowledge flow to you much more through weak ties than through the more insular strong ties of your trust circle.</p>

<p><strong>The Familiar Stranger</strong></p>

<p> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dlytle/2215047019/" title="Familar Strangers, from Blue Bottle Coffee Line by davitydave on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2125/2215047019_80e572fe0d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Familiar Strangers" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>Outside of our Emotional Circle is a larger, more tenuous circle: those people whose faces you recognize, but who you know nothing more about. These are your &quot;Familiar Strangers&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/familiar+stranger">Studies show</a> that the percentage of familiar strangers in your vicinity has a real impact on your willingness to take risks. If you are in a new place with no one that you recognize, you'll avoid eye contact and will generally be unwilling to approach strangers. In a place where there are a lot of people that you've seen before (say in your favorite cafe, at a conference, or in the lunchroom of a large company), you'll be much more willing to take risks, such as asking questions, or sitting down next to someone to eat lunch.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find any studies to show how many people that we can recognize, but for some people it is much larger than the number of people in your Emotional Circle, probably well over a thousand. However, there is also a lot more variance: some people are face-blind or near face-blind, and have a difficult time even recognizing friends.</p>

<p>There could also be some interesting research looking more closely at social network software. I find it fascinating that the professionally-oriented social network LinkedIn resisted supporting photos in profiles for so long yet ultimately failed, as well as how other social network software companies have attempted to require &quot;real&quot; photos of people rather then allowing "fakesters" or avatars.</p>

<h3>Crossing the Circles</h3>

<p>I've used the term &quot;circles&quot; throughout this article because it's a great metaphor for these levels of personal involvement. They can literally be thought of as concentric circles of people getting further and further away from an individual.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3054729757/" title="Personal Circles Landscape by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/3054729757_4fa37f7a6e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Personal Circles Landscape" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>However, if you want to consider them with an even more graphic bent, think of these circles as the ridge lines of a topographical map. An individual sits at the center, and around him lie many other people, fading slowly away as the distance increases.</p>

<p>Winding through these topographical lines, like forests or rivers, are geographies of physical and emotional connection.</p>

<p>Kin are one of the most interesting geographies, because they lie all across the map. There's a clump of them in the innermost circles, but there are also many who lie in the realm of Familiar Strangers, including those cousins and great-aunts who you only see at family gatherings, and whom you know nothing about.</p>

<p>There are also forces being exerted upon the circles, acting like gravity to draw people together. They are the forces of trust, influence, and more. Their pulls are greatest toward the center, across your Circles of Support and Sympathy, but as people move farther away, these forces drop off quickly.</p>

</p>Thus, though I've described them as circles, with strict boundaries, we should also see these personal connections as fluid entities, a regular ecosytem of personal community.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Whereas the group thresholds that I discussed in my last article define the limits placed on community group size, the personal limits described herein instead define the limits placed on how many people an individual can know with various degrees of intimacy.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are societies where these two things might be the same. A true survival community might contain everyone a person knows, and thus he could draw out all his personal circles across that community canvas. However, in our modern era they're much more likely to be distinct, with an individual interacting with the members of his circles of acquaintances through numerous different group communities.</p>

<p>With this bifurcation of personal and group community limits, we have to briefly stop and ask a few questions. How do they relate? What can personal limits tell us about efficient community creation? Does founding a group upon a personal circle make its growth easier or harder? Conversely, what type of communities lead naturally to the creation of intimate circles?</p>

</p>Herein I've simply outlined personal thresholds as a contrast to group thresholds. The exploration of how these limits interact is worthy of additional studies.</p>

<p>In my next article &quot;Community by the Numbers, Part III: Power Laws&quot;, I will talk about how both group thresholds and personal thresholds have a role in larger, less tightly-knit groups.</p>

We often think of communities as organic creatures, which come into existence and grow on their own. However, the truth is they are fragile blossoms. Although many communities surely germinate and bloom on their own, purposefully creating communities can take a tremendous amount of hard work, and one factor their success ultimately depends upon is their <em>numbers</em>.</p>

<p>If a community is too small you'll often have insufficient critical mass to sustain it. Conversely, if it's too large you can end up with a community that's too noisy, too cliquey, or otherwise problematic. These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.</p>

<p>We can analyze these community sizes in three ways. In this first article I'm going to talk about numerical group thresholds that have been observed in various sizes of tightly-knit communities, while in its sequel I'm going to talk about personal thresholds and how they relate to group thresholds. In my final post, I'm going to consider how power laws and inequalities of participation further complicate these simple values in the creation of larger communities. Together these three articles constitute what I call &quot;Community by the Numbers,&quot; a theory of community size.</p>

<p>Though I'm going to point to some studies which support these numbers, in general my goal here isn't to try and prove this theory of community size numbers, but rather to lay the theory out completely.</p>

<h3>Tightly-Knit Group Thresholds</h3>

<p>Groups can clearly exist at any size, from a partnership of two, on upward. However what I'm going to write about here are the threshold values: the ideal numbers where a community seems to function best, and the less than ideal numbers at which a community begins to grow unstable, remaining so until a new threshold number is reached.</p>

<p>I'm also specifically talking about groups that are both tightly-knit and participatory communities. Clearly Ford Motor Company, with 250,000 employees, doesn't match any of these group thresholds. But any self-contained community within Ford probably will (and in fact, it will probably be either a &quot;Working Group&quot; or a &quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Group&quot;, both terms I'll explain below). Similarly, a non-corporate community that doesn't <em>require</em> everyone to participate won't work quite the same as a community that does require participation from each member (though that's again the topic of the third article in this series).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.singers.com/jazz/group7.html"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/group7.jpg" title="Group7" alt="Group 7" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
<strong>7, &quot;The Working Group&quot;.</strong> <a name="Working_Group"></a>
This community size probably runs from about 4-9 members, but 7 is a pretty good average, and one that shows up in <a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/workinggroup">multiple studies</a>. This number may well relate to the general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_seven">rule of seven</a> (<a href="http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/">original paper</a>), which suggests that 7 is a number that the brain can easily and intuitively comprehend.</p>

<p>It has become increasingly clear that a tightly-knit group of 7 is the first group size which is truly an optimal community size. Groups below this size can function effectively, but risk not having
enough manpower to deliver a result that everyone is happy with, or having insufficient viewpoints to avoid group think. </p>

<p>Seven is not only an optimal size for a wide variety of corporate and government committees, it is also a healthy size for a small business and even a good size for a party of close friends. More importantly, 7 is a very comfortable group size as it &quot;feels&quot; relatively natural. At this size members find it easy to get to know the other members of the group, and they're able to function well together in a very intuitive and organic fashion.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=560,height=403,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="143" border="0" alt="Squad and Fire Team" title="Squad and Fire Team" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
An interesting example of this group size is the modern infantry
&quot;squad&quot;, which consists of two fire teams of 4 people, and a squad
leader, for a total of 9 people. Each fire team is is large enough to
function on its own, but together the group of 9 can still have effective
small group dynamics.</p>

<p>It is typically at this size that the first signs of leadership in a group informally emerge, but the leadership usually isn't overbearing at this level, nor does there tend to be any rebellion against it — perhaps because the group may be too small to elicit multiple leaders.</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)"><img width="200" height="109" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/lastsupper.jpg" title="Last Supper" alt="Last Supper" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a><a name="Judas_Number"></a>
13—&quot;The Judas Number&quot;.</em></strong> A group size of 13 doesn't represent a threshold ideal value, but rather a threshold nadir. It is one of the points where groups can change behavior and risk becoming dysfunctional. There's one of these nadirs beyond every group threshold, where the previously harmonious group dynamics become more difficult. I've chosen to highlight this specific number because it's a point that small communities often hit, particularly as entrepreneurial organizations try to grow above their startup beginnings.</p>

<p>(I should note that 13 isn't a precise number, but rather one offered because it's in the right range and because it's poetically easy to remember. The exact number occurs somewhere between 9 and 25, but I suspect it is worst in the range of 12-15.)</p>

<p>In a group of this community size no one ever feels like they get a fair share of time. Studies show that at this size participants underestimate the amount of time they contributed to the conversation, and thus will come out feeling like they were unfairly ignored despite having a fair share of the conversation. Groups of this size risk people being lumped into categories and ceasing to be trusted as individuals. In addition, problems start with the development of &quot;too many chiefs,&quot; yet there is not enough enough variety of non-chiefs for them to direct. Furthermore, multiple leaders may struggle for hierarchical status, increasing the conflict in an already troublesome group.</p>

<p>If your community is unfortunately stuck at this nadir, one of two things usually occurs.</p>

<p>Most commonly, the group shrinks. This could be because participants unhappy with the group dynamics abandon it; or it could occur in a more organized way with the unwieldy large group breaking into two or more smaller groups. For example, a terrible group of 13 could become two more functional groups of 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Alternatively, more energy could be expended. This could be in the form of more formal organization, rewards for participation, or more time to be casual and socialize in order to shake off the tensions of this size group. Though these efforts don't usually change the size of the group, they can improve its dynamics.</p>

<p>Energy could also be spent to help push the group up to the next threshold. Though this could occur naturally — for example if the group focuses on a topic of particular interest that causes new people to continually be added. In addition, in order to grow a group to a new threshold it often requires the efforts of more than one leader to succeed.</p>

<p>A group size of 13 isn't necessarily bad, just more difficult. Anthropological studies show that primitive hunting tribes often temporarily broke into &quot;bands&quot; of this size — my presumption is that the value of having that many people hunting together outweighed the social costs of the group. It is interesting that most juries are made up of groups this size. I believe that the social dynamics of this size of group with all new members creates some tension among the jurors, which may serve justice to make sure that all sides are considered by the jury without falling into groupthink. However, from my experience, the interpersonal conflict in a jury can also slow down the deliberation process and cause much frustration among the participants.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png"><img width="200" height="166" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png" title="Non-Exclusive Networks" alt="Non Exclusive Networks" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
50—&quot;The Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot;.</strong> <a name="Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number"></a>More properly this group size falls in the range of 25-75 participants, but it seems to feel the most natural in the range of 50-60. Studies of the sizes guilds in online games <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html">support</a> this hypothesis. For instance, based on graphs of the guild sizes in Ultima Online, groups have a median of 61 members. Similar numbers hold true in studies of a more recent game, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html">World of Warcraft</a>.</p>

<p>I call this value the &quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot; because it matches the lower end of a threshold that <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Robin Dunbar</a> set for group sizes. However, at this size it applies to mostly non-exclusive groupings, which includes the above mentioned online guilds, many employee communities, and the majority of social gatherings that manage to rise above the size of a Working Group. Groups of this size <em>can</em> be serious or take up a lot of time, but in general they are not exclusive — they don't tend to be the only group that individual participants are involved in.</p>

<p><strong>90—&quot;The Dunbar Valley&quot;.</strong> As Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number communities grow, they reach a point where increased time obligations and the noise of socialization required to keep the group cohesive requires a much more serious commitment from the participants. Like the Judas Number, the Dunbar Valley is a threshold nadir where more energy is required to keep a tightly-knit community together;&nbsp; either the community agrees to a higher level of commitment and grows to the next level, or the community splits apart.</p>

<p>I've found this to be true when growing a small business — where it is too small for any middle-management, but the sub-groups are too large for one person to manage effectively. I've also seen this with more ephemeral groups, such as when a small conference that worked well at 60 participants tries to grow and finds at at 100 participants they can't sustain a high enough intimacy level.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=290,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="145" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg" title="Roman Legion" alt="Roman Legion" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Another illustration of the Dunbar Valley is the history of the ancient Roman &quot;century&quot;, a grouping that was originally 100 soldiers. However, as the years went by, centuries tended to decrease in numbers to only include 70 or 80 soldiers. This might well be due to Non-Exclusive Dunbar constraints: even in a very devoted group of military men, there was still the need for relationships with other century groups, with support staff, and with camp followers, ultimately lowering the attention that could be spent on the century itself.</p>

<p><strong>150—&quot;The Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot;.</strong> Robin Dunbar got much of the discussion of group thresholds started with his <a href="http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/dunbar93coevolutionOf.html">article</a>, &quot;Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans.&quot; However, as I've written <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">previously</a>, and as I've described in this article, Dunbar's group threshold of 150 applies more to groups that are highly incentivized and relatively exclusive and whose goal is survival.</p>

<p>Dunbar makes this obvious by the statement that such a grouping &quot;would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.&quot; </p>

<p> The result of the grooming requirement is that communities bounded by the Exclusive Dunbar Number are relatively few. You will find hunter/gatherer and other subsistence societies where this is a natural tribe size. You'll also find these groups sizes in <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/03/what_is_the_opt.html">terrorist and mafia</a> organizations. </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=430,height=279,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg"><img width="200" height="129" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg" title="The Sopranos at Dinner" alt="The Sopranos at Dinner" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Clearly, as we step up toward higher group thresholds, more and more
time is required to simply keep the group going. You see this in
depictions of mafia life — in the TV series <em>The Sopranos</em> a lot of time
is spent dining, hanging out, and drinking together. That is part of that 42% social
grooming time required for that intense of a survival group.</p>

<p>It is possible for a large company to force groups up to this size by expending lots of energy (which is to say money) to keep it healthy. Apple did this during the invention of the Macintosh, the first OS X operating system, and the iPhone, but the intensity required of such large teams is not sustainable for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Without that extra energy, few modern tightly-knit communities can reach this threshold, or else can't hold it for very long. Instead they fracture into groups of individual interest (even if they continue to &quot;meet&quot; in the same real-world or online forum), which are more than more likely to be bounded by the Non-Exclusive Dunbar number.</p>

<p>Given the difficulty in even arriving at the Exclusive Dunbar number, it may well be the highest limit of all for a tightly-knit community. Beyond this limit, communities are less cohesive, less trusted, and less participatory (and the topic of my third article in this series.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are many different ways to measure groups, and one is by counting its members. As I've discussed here, the number of members can have a huge impact on whether the communities are successful or not. Thus, as community organizers, social software engineers, game designers, or as sociologists interested in community dynamics, we must ultimately consider group thresholds and group nadirs; to understand how to create cohesive communities, rather than groups that fly apart.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">next article</a> I'm going to talk about thresholds that are personal, rather then group-oriented.</p>

				<p>This blog has been quiet lately as I've been doing a lot of work in the last year on the iPhone. I've been speaking at conferences like eComm 2008 (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eComm2008/christopher-allens-presentation-at-ecomm-2008">presentation</a>, <a href="http://blogs.nmscommunications.com/communications/2008/05/heres-the-compl.html">video from panel</a>), writing an book on the iPhone with my co-author Shannon Appelcline called <a href="http://www.manning.com/callen">iPhone in Action: Introduction to Web and SDK Development</a> (first <a href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/callen/callen_meapch1-2.pdf">two chapters</a> free</a>), and I am one of the organizers for the upcoming <a href="http://www.iPhoneDevCamp.org">iPhoneDevCamp 2</a>, a MacHack style conference on August 1st-3rd, and I am working on some social software apps for the iPhone.</p>

<p>I've been reluctant to post too many of these off posts on this blog, as I like the length, quality and high-signal-to-noise ratio of the posts that I've written for this blog. I do plan to continue to offer more social software and social media posts, including followups to my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">Collective Choice</a> articles, as well as updates on my popular <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> posts. But I don't want to spam my readers here with notes on iPhone Apps, my thoughts on movies, circuses, the odd conferences I speak at, etc.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/2610236112/" title="Downtown Seoul, South Korea, from Hotel Window by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3067/2610236112_a59ce2f7b5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Downtown Seoul, South Korea, from Hotel Window" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>I'm in Seoul, South Korea this week for the <a href="http://www.globalforumactionlearning.com/">13th Global Forum on Business Driven Action Learning and Executive Development</a>, where I'm presenting on the topic of the how to get involved with the Social Web.</p>

<p>My presentation is an offshoot of an odd sideline of mine, executive blog and social web coaching. Basically, many times over the last couple of years I've been asked by colleagues and friends to help them with the social web. I've always been honored to spend the time to teach them how to blog, better manage the noise of the web by using a feed reader, how to participate in social networks, and how to improve their personal brand.</p>

<p>Increasingly, the social network of their peers is now asking me to help them to do the same for them. So I've been doing this more and more over the last year on a consulting basis as their social networks appear to be saying saying that I have a lot to offer.</p>

<p>I've twice now been out to Cincinnati where I've been working with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/5/3a9/480">Drew Boyd</a> at Johnson & Johnson, where I've been coaching him on his blog and personal brand. He has been blogging now for almost six months at <a href="http://www.innovationinpractice.com/">Innovation in Practice</a> with some success. Now he is referring me to other executives at Johnson & Johnson who need similar coaching, or need strategic advice on how to deal with specific social web initiatives within Johnson & Johnson.</p>

<p>Most recently, Drew has asked me to join him in Seoul to speak at the Global Forum, which is a worldwide gathering of executive trainers. There I am presenting a synopsis of what I teach, and how they can begin to learn how to teach their staff how to do the same. My trip has been sponsored by Johnson & Johnson, so it has been a lot of fun to be here. I get to both dive into deep discussions of methodologies for teaching inside business, as well as learn about the Korean and other international business cultures and how they are different from the United States.</p>

<p>During the evenings I've had a chance to wander the streets of downtown Seoul. It is very different then wandering though streets in Europe, not only because of the different culture and language, but also because all of the signs are in Hangul, the korean character set. Very few signs use the roman alphabet, so it is often very difficult to figure out what is what without walking in. Like Japan, there are some signs in English to represent a brand or a style, but not many. Even China has more signs in English then Korean's do -- the last time I was there I was surprised by how almost every important sign was in both Chinese and English, so much so I was beginning to learn Chinese language characters just by association! Despite the language problems everyone is nice and it feels safe to wander in these neighborhoods.</p>

<p>I return on Monday, and I'll make a copy of my final presentation available here.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atow/750701139/"><img width="200" height="133" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2007/07/08/everyone.jpg" title="Everyone" alt="Everyone" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> I feel privileged and honored to have been part of the <a href="http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp">iPhoneDevCamp</a> this last weekend. Over 380 iPhone developers came out to the Adobe Campus in San Francisco to help each other make the best possible web pages and webapps for the iPhone.</p>

<p>I was the keynote speaker on Saturday and Master of Ceremonies for the MacHack-style <a href="http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCampHackAThon">Hack-a-Thon Demo</a> on Sunday.</p>

<p>At the Hack-a-Thon almost 50 iPhone web applications were demonstrated to an enthusiastic audience. Take a look at <a href="http://www.xeodesign.com/tilt">Tilt</a>, a game that takes advantage of the iPhone's motion sensor, <a href="http://www.mxis.com/pickleview">PickleView</a>, which is a same-time live baseball game enhancer, and <a href="http://www.bartholo.com/devcamp/pool.html">The Pool</a>, an attractive social game of water droplets hitting a pool. What is remarkable about these applications is not just the quality, but that each of them was written over just the weekend by a small team of 3-4 people who hadn't met each other before Friday!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/snackfight/750214294/"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2007/07/08/hewitt.jpg" title="Hewitt" alt="Hewitt" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> Prizes were awarded after the Hack-a-Thon based on the spirit of openness, contribution, sharing, and participation. Prizes included 3 iPhones and some very expensive Adobe software. In particular <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a>, of <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> fame, was honored for his positive contributions, generous spirit, and wonderful iPhone UI <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/files/iphone/navigation.html">example code</a>. During the demonstrations, more than one person praised Joe, saying that his assistance, his code, or his debugger made their apps possible. Personally, I think about one-third of the web apps presented used some of his code.</p>

<p>Building on my experience with the same-time collaboration tool <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>, and the <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> web-based games, I worked remotely with <a href="http://www.kallealm.com/">Kalle</a> from Sweden and <a href="http://is-here.com/">Erwin</a> from Kansas to present an AJAX chat application called <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/">iLace</a>. I am particularly proud of how well this little web application performs and how well it works using the iPhone UI. In particular, I think its melding of text entry and chat message receipt and its response to changes between portrait and landscape modes are very good examples of what can be done for chat on the iPhone. Source code is <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/about.html">available</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atow/749665338/"><img width="200" height="133" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2007/07/08/keynote.jpg" title="Keynote" alt="Keynote" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> My keynote presentation slides are now available in <a href="http://iphonedevcamp.org/stuff/iPhoneDevCamp_Keynote.pdf">.pdf</a> and <a href="http://iphonedevcamp.org/stuff/iPhoneDevCamp_Keynote.mov">.mov</a>. I'm told a live recording of the session and an .mp3 will be available soon.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks an online developer community that I started at WWDC called <a href="http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com">iPhoneWebDev</a> has grown to over 650 members. It's now the best place to get online support for building iPhone web pages and webapps. I'd like to keep the momentum from the iPhoneDevCamp going forward on this list, so if you are interested in developing for the iPhone, check out the <a href="http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com/examples">example code</a> and <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com/">join</a> the discussion today!</p>

                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/ad4/"><img border="0" alt="Watereddown" title="Watereddown" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/15/watereddown.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
I've been excited about the web capabilities of the upcoming <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> for some time. As a reluctant laptop user (&quot;oh, my aching shoulders&quot;), there is real appeal to me in a better portable web browser. I have tried most of the PDA and cellphone browsers to date, and none offer more then a poor cousin to the web that we experience on the desktop.</p>

<p>Instead, the iPhone offers a desktop-class browser. There is no transcoding, nor any subset of HTML such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language">WML</a>. Full web pages are rendered in the small display, and when you &quot;double-tap&quot; with your finger the section you touch is expanded to a more readable size. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/ad4/">video</a> available at the Apple website shows this capability in use.</p>

<p>Because of the iPhone's upcoming July 29th release, I decided to participate in this week's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple WWDC</a> conference for Macintosh developers. There a number of announcements about the iPhone were released, and a number of technical sessions on the iPhone and iPhone-related technologies were held. Together the iPhone demonstrations at the public keynote and other demonstrations throughout the WWDC offered some real promise for when the phone is released on June 29th.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=440,height=292,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/15/iphonesteve.jpg"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2007/06/15/iphonesteve.jpg" title="Iphonesteve" alt="Iphonesteve" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
The biggest announcement at the public <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/d7625zs/event/">keynote</a> was that there will not be an SDK for building native iPhone apps; instead, the only way for third parties to get involved is to create web applications optimized for the iPhone. This came as a big disappointment to the majority of developers participating at WWDC. However, as someone who has been involved lately in creating AJAX/Web 2.0 apps, I was less unhappy.</p>

<p>The other significant announcement at the keynote was that a <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Safari 3.0 beta</a> for both Mac and Windows was being released and that a third Safari platform would be released on July 29th—inside the iPhone. This means that web 2.0 applications created to work with Safari on the Mac will likely also work on the iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.synchroedit.com"><img border="0" alt="SynchroEdit" title="SynchroEdit" src="http://www.synchroedit.com/img/selogo-nobox-green.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Since <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>, an open-source simultaneous web editor (in the style of <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>) for Firefox that I produced last year, is one of the most sophisticated AJAX/Web 2.0 applications, I dug deeper at various WWDC sessions to see if it might be possible to make SynchroEdit work on the iPhone.</p>

<p>One of the biggest things that SynchroEdit needs in order to function is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents">DOM Mutation Events</a>. At a party for <a href="http://www.webkit.org">WebKit</a> (the open source code underpinnings of Safari's web renderer) and in questions after a session at WWDC it was confirmed that these are available to Safari 3.0 and presumably the iPhone.</p>

<p>The other key ability that SynchroEdit requires is WYSIWYG editing. This was terribly broken in Safari 2.0, but I saw many demonstrations of it working in Safari 3.0, so I don't anticipate any problems with this.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit also requires AJAX and in particular the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XMLHttpRequest</a> function, and the keynote clearly said that this was available.</p>

<p>The final thing that SynchroEdit needs is the ability to keep the browser at <em>readystate==3</em>, i.e. not &quot;finish&quot; sending the page, so that we can continue to interactively pass updates to users as they arrive, without creating a new connection for every message. It is not clear if this will be supported on the iPhone, but there are ways to work around it.</p>

<p>So, in principle, it appears that we should be able to make SynchoEdit work on the iPhone. I am not sure that many iPhone users need SynchroEdit, but as an example of a very sophisticated web technology that should work on that platform, it shows the potential for what might be possible.</p>

<p>Because of this technological capability I've decided to begin investigating what type of social software apps could be highly useful on the iPhone and that aren't being served by the existing web 2.0 community. I am also going to continue investigating the technical issues of developing web apps for the iPhone</p>

<p>If you are interested as well, I invite you to participate in the new <a href="http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com/">iPhoneWebDev</a> community. It should be a great resource for everyone interested in getting in on the ground floor with this new web technology. I have also begun tagging relevant web pages in <a href="http://del.icio.us/ChristopherA">del.icio.us</a> with the tag <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/iphonewebdev">iphonewebdev</a>—I hope that others will begin to use this tag as well.</p>

<p>I have quite a bit more I'd like to write about specific iPhone technology, but unfortunately I have to wait until the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/attendee/">WWDC confidentiality</a> expires on June 29th with the release of the iPhone, so keep an eye out here for more details.</p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 0.7em;">by Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline</span></p>

<p><em>[This is the fourth in a series of articles on <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href="http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline">Shannon Appelcline</a>. It will be <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml">jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml">Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a>.]</em></p>

<p>Last year in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/collective_choi.html">Collective Choice: Rating Systems</a> we took a careful look at eBay and other websites that collect ratings, and used those systems as examples to highlight a number of theories about how to make rating systems more useful.</p>

<p>We suggested three main methods for improving rating systems:</p>

<p><strong>Granular Ratings:</strong> Based on the clumping of ratings to high values, we believed that ratings could be made more useful by increasing the size of a rating scale. Most rating scales are 5-point ranges, so we suggested a 10-point range instead.</p>

<p><strong>Distinct Ratings:</strong> Raters can be somewhat arbitrary in how they rate items, varying both from each other and even from themselves (usually over multiple sessions). Thus we believed that providing explicit statements of what each number meant could improve ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Ratings:</strong> Finally we stated that in low volumes ratings could be biased by various quirks of data entry, either malevolent or not, and that ratings could be improved with strong statistical methods being used to polish up data and automatically keep &quot;bad&quot; data in line with &quot;good&quot;.</p>

<p>In the year since we wrote that article we've decided to practice what we preach and have rolled out an entirely new rating system called <a href="http://index.rpg.net">The RPGnet Gaming Index</a>. We've applied all of the above theories and thus far it looks like they're not only working, but that they're actually providing better rating systems than previous ones we've used at the RPGnet site.</p>

<p>In this article we're going to step through the data we've collected from this experience and see how it applies to our theory: first by looking at our previous RPGnet rating system, then by looking at the new system, and finally by by examining the data from these two systems and comparing their results. We've also run into some unexpected troubles along the way, and we'll talk about that too.</p>

<h3>The RPGnet Reviews System</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.rpg.net"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/rpgnetlogo_1.gif" title="Rpgnetlogo_1" alt="Rpgnetlogo_1" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
RPGnet is our gaming site for tabletop roleplaying—games like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>. We purchased it in 2001 from the original owners. One of the benefits of RPGnet was that it had a very large community. As of today it sports one of the top-100 forums on the Internet, with over 1000 simultaneous users regularly logging in. However, because of its maturity, we also inherited many existing systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9971.phtml"><img border="0" alt="Rpgnet_review_summary_1" title="Rpgnet_review_summary_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/rpgnet_review_summary_1.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
One of these was the <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/">RPGnet Reviews System</a> which gave individual users the ability to review gaming products—mostly role-playing games, but also board games, books, DVDs, and a smattering of related products.</p>

<p>Most of these reviews are submitted by average readers who just want to talk about a product that they like (or don't), though a fair percentage are instead submitted by staff reviewers. (Overall at least 26% of our reviews are based on publisher &quot;comp&quot; copies, and thus may be considered largely professional, while the other 74% may or may not be.) The large community size of RPGnet applies to the Reviews System as well: currently it features 8,505 published reviews.</p>

<p>Looking at the RPGnet Reviews through our three filters we find the following:</p>

<p><strong>Granularity.</strong> The ratings from our existing reviews aren't as granular as we'd like. We have a theoretical scale of 2-10, but that's based upon a Style rating of 1-5 and a Substance rating of 1-5.</p>

<table cellpadding="5">
<thead>
<tr align="right">
<td><strong>Rating</strong></td>
<td><strong>Style</strong></td>
<td><strong>Substance</strong></td>
<td><strong>%</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr align="right">
<td>1</td>
<td>81</td>
<td>225</td>
<td>1.8%</td>
</tr>

<tr align="right">
<td>2</td>
<td>732</td>
<td>651</td>
<td>8.1%</td>
</tr>

<tr align="right">
<td>3</td>
<td>2364</td>
<td>1777</td>
<td>24.3%</td>
</tr>

<tr align="right">
<td>4</td>
<td>3618</td>
<td>3525</td>
<td>42.0%</td>
</tr>

<tr align="right">
<td>5</td>
<td>1709</td>
<td>2326</td>
<td>23.7%</td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>

<p> Approximately 90% of raters rate only with values of 3-5, and thus our scale is more limited than the 2-10 range would indicate. 42.9% of reviews further rate Style and Substance exactly the same, suggesting that not everyone sees a difference between these two elements. On the whole this scale isn't as a bad as a singular 5-point scale, but it also isn't a real 10-point scale, and the two orthogonal types of comparison don't necessarily provide a coherent description of a product.</p>

<p><strong>Distinctiveness.</strong> Conversely, the review ratings are fairly distinct because the Review System provides an explanation of what each rating number means. For example the five Substance ratings are: I Wasted My Money (1); Sparse (2); Average (3); Meaty (4); Excellent(5). The descriptions could be better, but hopefully they connect to some users in meaningful ways, and help them to rate consistently.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Our review ratings have no statistical basis. These values are used entirely unfiltered.</p>

<p>On the whole, the existing RPGnet Reviews embodied slightly less than half of what we wanted to see in a rating systems: some improvement over a simple 5-point scale; some effort put into making individual ratings distinct; and nothing statistical.</p>

<p>There is room for improvement, however, as we'll see when we analyze this system more fully.</p>

<h3>The RPGnet Gaming Index</h3>

<p>Our newer system is the <a href="http://index.rpg.net/">RPGnet Gaming Index</a>. It doesn't supersede our Reviews, but instead offers a complementary look at the roleplaying field. The Index is essentially an RPG industry database. It contains individual entries for many different gamebooks—currently 5248—and allows registered users to rate each of them. Those ratings are then turned into averages by various mathematical formulas on a nightly basis and the roleplaying games in our index are then ranked.</p>

<p>The large size of RPGnet has allowed us to very quickly turn our ideas of a Gaming Index into reality. Just six months after release we have:</p>

<ul><li>5248 well-written Index entries </li>
<li> 5908 different editions</li>
<li> 4240 authors</li>
<li> 4478 covers</li>
<li> 360 different game systems</li>
<li> 345 series</li>
<li> 10142 individual ratings</li></ul>

<p>Most of the ratings are clumped around the best and worst games, with many less popular games unrated as of yet. Four different items have at least 80 ratings each (<em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, <em>Exalted</em>, <em>Nobilis</em>, and <em>Unknown Armies</em>). Our average rating is 6.79. Ratings above 7.82 are in the 99th
percentile, ratings above 7.21 are in the 90th percentile, and ratings
below 6.53 are beneath the 10th percentile.</p>

<p>(For more info on the creation of the RPG Index, and how to encourage user generated content, see Shannon's articles, &quot;Managing User Creativity&quot;, <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_192.phtml">Part One</a> and <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_193.phtml">Part Two</a>.) </p>

<p>The RPGnet Index also handles some unusual situations, such as when a game book contains other game books as part of an anthology or compilation. For instance, the 8-book compilation <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=64">In Search of Adventure</a> has a composite rating of <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry-ratings.phtml?mainid=64">6.57</a> which is partially based upon the individual adventures that make it up.</p>

<p><strong>Granularity:</strong> The first thing we did was provide a 10-point scale for this new system.</p>

<p><strong>Distinctiveness:</strong> We also made sure each point of the scale was clearly defined. Currently the points of our scale are: Worthless (1), Poor (2), Some Flaws (3), Almost Average (4), Average (5), Above Average (6), Good (7), Very Good (8), Outstanding (9), and One of the Best Ever (10).</p>

<p>We made some mistakes in our original release of our &quot;distinctive&quot; titles, and we discovered this had real effects on the user input, telling us that these title labels <em>are</em> meaningful to users.</p>

<p>First, we initially labeled 6 as &quot;average&quot;, to mirror the rating system for our existing Reviews, rather than setting 5 to be average. But as we noted in our first article, people like to be nice, and thus they tend to rate on the good side of a scale. Changing the label for our definition of average from 6 to 5 has slowly started dropping the average of all ratings down as a result (providing more breadth, a topic we'll talk about more shortly).</p>

<p>Second, two of our original distinctive titles were at odds with the others. Our original &quot;2&quot; value said that the game had &quot;a few useful elements&quot; and our original &quot;9&quot; value said that it was the &quot;best of the year&quot;. The 2 was much more specific than any of our other terms and the 9 created a comparative query that was very different from anything else. Overall our ratings conformed to a bell curve centered between 6 and 7, but we saw very clear dropouts in our curve at 2 and 9, telling us that we'd made mistakes in those terms, and that people were less willing to use them as a result. Since we've made the change to our current set of titles those two discontinuities have disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Finally, we fully integrated statistics into our new Index by using two main methods: bayesian weights and trust.</p>

<p>We explained bayesian weights pretty fully in our previous article. Here's what we said then:</p>

<blockquote>
<table width="90%" border="1" cellpading="3"><tbody><tr><p>
The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site, and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings. The basic formula looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
b(r) = [ W(a) * a + W(r) * r ] / (W(a) + W(r)]</code></p>

<p>r = average rating for an item</p>

<p>W(r) = weight of that rating, which is the number of ratings</p>

<p>a = average rating for your collection</p>

<p>W(a) = weight of that average, which is an arbitrary number, but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items; 100 is used here, for a database which expects many ratings per item</p>

<p>b(r) = new bayesian rating </p>

<p>Say three &quot;shill&quot; users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a &quot;10&quot; because the producer asked them to. However, you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100, and thus 3 ratings won't move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50:</p>

<p><code>
b(r) = [100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10] / (100 + 3)</code><code><br />b(r) = 680 / 103</code><code><br />b(r) = 6.60
</code>
</p></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>We implemented bayesian weights exactly as we'd detailed, but with a lower weight of 25. Since then we've accrued over 10,000 ratings in the database, and we can probably start thinking about cranking that weight up, another topic we'll return to.</p>

<p>Our trust-based algorithms suggest that some ratings are better than others, and should thus be more trusted (and thus more weighted when we calculate the average rating of an item). Though bayesian weights have been used before, we're not aware of other systems that weight ratings based on trust. </p>

<p>The calculation of trust is very simple:</p>

<p><code>
Weight = 0 if #ratings(user) &lt;= 2</code><code><br />Otherwise Weight = #ratings(user) / 50 to a maximum of 2</code><code><br />Weight *= 2, to a maximum of 4, if the user included a comment
</code>

</p>

<p>This was based on the idea that the average good rater would rate 25 different items and the average great rater would rate at least 50. Additionally, we believed that ratings with comments were more likely to be thoughtful than those without.</p>

<p>That, overall, is a quick picture of what we've done with the RPGnet Gaming Index. Some of these ideas were laid out from the start, and others have been tuned as we progressed. </p>

<p>So how did we do, particularly in comparison to our existing RPGnet Reviews System?</p>



<h3>The Comparison</h3>

<p>One of our goals in improving rating systems has been to widen the range of possible input. As we noted earlier we discovered that 90% of our RPGnet Reviews Ratings were in the 3-5 range, and only 10% in the 1-2 range.</p>

<p>Generally, we can measure the success of widening a range by seeing whether the average rating of a database moves toward the <em>true</em> average. For the purposes of a 10-point scale from 1-10, that's a desired value of 5.5. That generally means we're looking for our average rating to <em>decrease</em> because people tend to rate high.</p>

<p>The following table compares the average results of Reviews ratings and Index ratings.</p>

<center><table cellpadding="3" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Database</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Converted Reviews</strong></td>

<td>7.25</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Massaged Reviews</strong></td>

<td>7.29</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Unweighted Index</strong></td>

<td>7.10</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Weighted Index</strong></td>

<td>6.78</td></tr>
</tbody></table></center>

<p>Here's what the categories in the above chart represent:</p>

<p><strong>Converted Reviews:</strong> The Style + Substance of the Reviews, converted from its 2-10 scale to a 1-10 scale: </p>

<p><code>
$rating = avg($style) + avg($substance);</code><br /><code>$rating = ($rating * 1.125) - 1.25;
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Massaged Reviews:</strong> The Style + Substance of the Reviews, with Substance given double weight over Style because we think that more closely reflects the intentions of the reviewer, converted from its 2-10 scale to a 1-10 scale:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = (average($style) + 2*average($substance))/1.5;</code><br /><code>$rating = ($rating * 1.125) - 1.25;
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Unweighted Index:</strong> Index ratings exactly as users have entered into our Gaming Index:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = average($index-rating);
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Weighted Index:</strong> Index ratings adjusted by the weight of each individual rating, which is based on user trust and inclusion of comments:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = average($index-rating*$index-weight)/average($index-weight);
</code>

</p>

<p>Our average rating—which is our criteria for success—decreased somewhat from the Reviews System to the Gaming Index and it decreased much more dramatically when we introduced our trust systems.</p>

<p>The following chart shows the a typical example of how review and index ratings differ, using the venerable <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook</em> as an example:</p>

<center><a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry-ratings.phtml?mainid=72"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only.jpg" title="Dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only" alt="Dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only" /><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only.jpg" title="Dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only" alt="Dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only" /></a></center><p>For this book the median ratings from reviews-only is 8, and the median from index-only is 7. A one-to-two point drop in median rating from reviews to index was consistent in all of our most-rated games other than those which were a rated a &quot;10&quot; in both places.</p>

<p>We believe that this initial success of our unweighted Gaming Index can be attributed to the slightly better <em>granularity</em>—a 10-point scale versus two 5-point scales—and our improved <em>distinctiviness</em>—based on better naming of the rating levels. The veracity of this will ultimately be played out as the Index grows.</p>

<p>However we have no doubt that our <em>statistical</em> approach to the index data, when we moved from our unweighted Index to our weighted Index, is providing even better results. We had theorized that users who input more and who include comments would provide &quot;better&quot; data, and by our criteria of the average of the ratings moving toward 5.5 that seems to be borne out. The following table looks at the information a bit more precisely, by comparing average ratings as total number of ratings increases over several ranges:</p>

<center><table cellpadding="3" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong># of Ratings</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average w/Comment</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average w/o Comment</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>1-2</strong></td>

<td>8.55</td>

<td>8.88</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>3-24</strong></td>

<td>8.08</td>

<td>8.16</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>25-49</strong></td>

<td>7.32</td>

<td>7.11</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>50-99</strong></td>

<td>7.14</td>

<td>7.03</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>100+</strong></td>

<td>6.17</td>

<td>6.99</td></tr></tbody></table></center>

<p>This table fairly definitively shows that base maxim: that the breadth of the ratings, and thus their quality, increases the more ratings a user makes. The improved quality of ratings with comments is less definitive. Among the vast mass of users the two values are pretty close, and sometimes the reverse of what we expect, but for the best and the worst users, ratings with comments seem to be better than those without. This latter point is another one that we'll have to continue to monitor as the Index grows beyond its current total of 10,000 ratings.</p>

<p>The other major element of our <em>statistical</em> approach to the Index is our bayesian weight. The following chart shows a top-ten chart for roleplaying games calculated via four different methodologies: our Reviews; our Index with no weighting; our Index with a 25 bayesian weighting (as it currently stands); and our Index with a 50 bayesian weighting:</p>

<p>We actually <em>did</em> do a little bit of statistical analysis on the Reviews because on our first try to produce this chart we got a random clump of reviews that were 5/5 from a much larger pool, so we further ordered them by descending total count of reviews, and as a result you're seeing a better selection of ranked reviews than a truly unstatistical sampling would allow. We did the same for the unweighted Index (which clumped a number of results at &quot;10&quot;), except we further ordered items at the same weight by decreasing number of views (another statistical decision).</p>

<p>Clearly, deciding which of these lists is &quot;right&quot; is a much more subjective measure than the mathematical analysis we were able to apply to earlier problems. However, most roleplayers would tell you that the unweighted Reviews and Index lists are terrible. The top 5 items in the Reviews list actually aren't bad for a starting list of good games—but only because we did the aforementioned statistical ordering. Before that we just had a random listing of gaming items. Even with our attempts at quickie statistical analysis the unweighted Index is still quite bad, with only <em>Talislanta</em> regularly showing up on other &quot;best&quot; lists.</p>

<p>The problem is the ability of one person to come in and rate an item a &quot;10&quot; (or a &quot;5&quot;/&quot;5&quot;), thereby making that item more highly rated than <em>any</em> item which has an actual consensus of ratings. Of our unweighted top Reviews only the top three had more than 2 reviews and the rest had 2. Not surprisingly those top three were the best fits to a typical top-ten list. Of the unweighted Index only the top three had more than 1 rating, and the rest had 1. Our single good pick was in those top three.</p>

<p>Our 25-weight Index, which is what we currently use, has been generally accepted by the RPGnet community as a good marker of what's good and what's not. However there have been two items on it which some percentage of people disagree with: <em>Spirit of the Century</em> and <em>Pulp Hero</em>. It's instructive to see that when we increase to a 50-weight Index <em>Spirit of the Century</em> drops (even more notably than depicted here, because its actual rating changes from .01 from first place to .16 from first place) and <em>Pulp Hero</em> disappears entirely.</p>

<p>The questions of <em>what</em> to set your bayesian weight to, when to increase it, and what maximum value to set it to are all relatively unstudied and thus we don't have good answers to them. As we pass 10,000 ratings we're considering upping the bayesian value to 50. We expect that 100 will be our ultimate value when the Index is fully mature, however if we increase the weight too far an older, less rated game will never be able to get enough weight to get out of the doldrums.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We're by no means done with this ratings experiment. Though we've pleased and impressed with the growth of the RPGnet Index thus far, by next year we hope that the Index will include the vast majority of all games in print (as opposed to somewhat less than half now) and that our 10,000 ratings will grow to 50,000 or more. This will allow us to offer even more definitive answers to our questions.</p>

<p>In the meantime we're still mucking with our statistics and facing new problems.&nbsp; Some of the newest:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What to do about drive-by ratings:</strong> Our trust algorithm does a good job of making drive-by ratings, where a publisher points his audience to an item in our site, mostly irrelevant, but there's some concern that they could have more effect in the long run.</li>

<li><strong>How to incorporate our review ratings in our index ratings:</strong> It seems a shame to waste the thousands of reviews that have been written—and indeed currently they're calculated into a composite rating we use in the Index—but we're realizing that people have very different purposes for writing reviews and inputing ratings, which may result in some of the upward skew we see on the review side of things. Ultimately we need to decide whether they're just too different or whether our statistical massaging is enough to incorporate those reviews into a composite Index rating.</li>

<li><strong>How to pick some of our numbers:</strong> As we already noted we don't have good formulas for when to choose which bayesian weights. Likewise we've been guessing at which values to use for the trust-based weighting of our raters. Originally we set our desired rating count to 100 for good rater and 200 for great raters, but we've since dropped those to 50 for good and 100 for great based upon the real numbers of ratings that users were making. Again, we'd prefer to derive an actual formula for this type of calculation</li></ul>

<p>Shannon has discussed some of these issues more in his recent article <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_198.phtml">More Thoughts Abour Ratings</a>.</p>

<p>Despite unanswered questions, we still feel good about the basic ideas we laid out in our article last year. We have no doubt that giving our ratings a <em>statistical</em> basis has dramatically improved them and evidence thus far suggests that both <em>granularity</em> and <em>distinctiveness</em> have been helpful as well.<br />
