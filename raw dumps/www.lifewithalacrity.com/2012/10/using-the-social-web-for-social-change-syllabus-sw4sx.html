			<p>This fall with be the 4th year, and the 5th time that I&#39;ve taught the class&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu/changing-business/social-web-for-social-change/" style="font-size: 10pt;" target="_self">Using the Social Web for Social Change</a>&#0160;(hashtag #SW4SX) in the&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/hybrid-mba/" style="font-size: 10pt;" target="_self">MBA in Sustainable Systems</a>&#0160;program at&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu" style="font-size: 10pt;" target="_self">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>&#0160;(BGI.edu).</p>
<p>The class itself is an elective, but has become so popular that during this school year I am running the class three times: once this summer, again this fall, and a third time in the spring. This class is unique because it crosses class cohorts; it has also been available to members of the Seattle&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/metro-mba/" target="_self">Metro MBA</a> program; is the most popular class for auditing and alumni participation; and we have even had some faculty and TAs take the course. This means that we get a genuine cross-section of BGI and it has been a real inspiration and positive influence on the broader community and on other classes in the program.</p>
<p>The class itself is delivered in a hybrid (sometimes called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning" target="_self">blended</a>) format — that is that we meet face-to-face on&#0160;three different weekends for 6 hours each time over the course of a quarter. Supplementing those sessions, we meet online weekly in a synchronous chat room hosted by <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx" target="_self">Blackboard Collaborate</a>. In addition to being part of a hybrid program, my personal goal is for the class to be a completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching" target="_self">flipped classroom</a>, i.e. we reserve both face-to-face time AND our synchronous time in Collaborate for exercises, keeping lectures to a minimum. If I find myself lecturing, I try to record it so that in the next version of the course we can move the lecture into the readings.</p>
<p>This year is the first year that all MBA students are required to have iPads in the classroom. For many classes this will be mostly for electronic books, but in my class we will be using them for research, collaboration, social media, social networking and much more.</p>
<p>I have always intended the course content to be publically available, but I have just not had the time to massage it to the quality level that I was satisfied with. This year I have two TAs, whose assistance allows me to devote more time to making some of this material available to the public.</p>
<p>All of my course content is available under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_self">Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike</a> license.</p>
<p>Here is the official syllabus for this fall&#39;s class:</p>
<h2>Using the Social Web for Social Change</h2>
<p><strong>Course Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This course will focus on using the latest social online tools to effect social change. The course will incorporate technical and practical aspects of the social web, as well as critical discussion of the latest theories on how to effectively influence change using social web technologies. &#0160;Students will leave the class being comfortable creating a persuasive social web site or a social video on a sustainability topic, using either computer based or tablet based tools. </p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the new and helpful tools available to them in the tool chest of open technologies called Web 2.0. Students will receive both a practical and a theoretical grounding in social networking, leading and participating in virtual teams, integrating the web into marketing efforts, and using the web to support social change. Students will use both computers and tablets for the duration of this course and will learn new and helpful tools specific to each device.</p>

Students should expect at least 2 hours of asynchronous learning (readings, written assignments, group activities) for every synchronous contact hour in this course. </p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
