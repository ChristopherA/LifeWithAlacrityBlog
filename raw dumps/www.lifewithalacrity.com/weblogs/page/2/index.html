                                <p>I have for some time told people that one way that my blog was different was because I was focused on offering a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">high signal-to-noise ratio</a>. I told them that they could subscribe to my blog safely, as I'd not inundate them with anything but the highest quality posts.</p>

<p>At first, this meant that I'd not post unless I had something significant to add to the topic. No simple pointers to interesting ideas, no simple rephrasing, or simple agreement -- I had to add value.</p>

<p>For some time I think I succeeded -- I received a lot of praise for my posts on social networking, on internet security, on FOAF, on the Dunbar number, and on my tool EditThisPagePHP. However, I've found that for each post my standards were growing higher. My most recent posts took significantly more time to write, and I believe were much more like articles then they are like the typical blog post.</p>

<p>I haven't posted now for a couple of months, and I realized this week that part of the problem is that I've become intimidated by my own standard. For every new post to meet the quality of some of my best posts is too difficult.</p>

<p>So I'm lowering my standards somewhat -- I will be posting some more small, pithy topics, rather then my longer rants. However, I do hope to continue to offer a good signal-to-noise ratio, and still add value.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/handcrafting_my.html">Hand-Crafting My FOAF</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While at <a href="http://etech.weblogsinc.com/">eTech</a>, I attended a number of "social software" sessions. One thing I heard was a persistent call from folk like <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/">Marc Canter</a> for all the vendors to support something called <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a>. FOAF is a standard for "Friend of a Friend" files, and is an attempt to make <em>machine readable</em> information about people, groups, companies, and other online resources. In particular, it is focused on representing the information that you might typically put on your personal home page in a form such that meta-data tools can interpret it.</p>

<p>If you are using the blog service <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a> or the social networking service <a href="http://www.ecademy.com">Ecademy</a> you may already have a FOAF file without knowing it, and <a href="http://www.tribe.net">Tribe.Net</a> announced at eTech that they were promising to support it as well for their social networking service.</p>

<p>FOAF as a standard is still in a fairly primitive state -- to me it feels like HTML did during the days of the early Mosaic browser, when every good web page had to be hand-crafted in a text editor and uploaded to a server. However, like HTML, it may have great promise.</p>

<p>The first thing that FOAF may offer us is a way to exchange information between various social networking services. For instance, I just exported all my <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> friends into my own FOAF file by hand, but there are those who are working on tools to do this automatically, and once Tribe offers FOAF, services like Orkut may be forced to do the same.</p>

<p>Probably more important in the long run is that FOAF may decentralize the data that you make public about yourself -- to put the data under your own control. Owned by you rather then owned by the services you use. For instance, many people have <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/35375.html">complained about Orkut's ownership of information</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with FOAF right now is that it doesn't support very much "progressive disclosure" or privacy. Progressive disclosure is how people typically handle private information -- they disclose information about themselves a bit at a time, and as trust builds, offer more. The only small measure of privacy that FOAF has is that it has a way to obscure email addresses so that they can't easily be harvested by spammers. But all your other information is totally public. Theoretically you can <a href="http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles">encrypt your FOAF</a> file, but this method requires external PGP-based encrypted files. There is also the possibility of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/">XML-DSIG</a>, however, I find this standard to also be extremely cumbersome right now. <a href="http://www.plaxo.com">Plaxo</a> is a major social networking service that has some excellent <a href="http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/000007.html">comments on FOAF privacy</a> and other issues.</p>

<p>What I want is something that allows people to make 'local' assertions about themselves and their friends, and be able to have those friends be able to 'discover' more information by using those assertions. Ron Rivest came out with an interesting method for this in an old project called <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sdsi10.html">SDSI - A Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure</a> that I hope will inspire a few FOAF architects someday. To adopt his method for FOAF requires everyone to have a FOAF service script somewhere and not just a data file. But we've seen broad adoption of personal RSS and Trackback services, so I don't think this is a huge obstacle to overcome.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to play around with FOAF take over control of your own public data, I've included detailed information on how to get started in hand-crafting your own FOAF file.</p>

<h4>Hand-Crafting your own FOAF</h4>

<p>First, start with <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html">FOAF-a-Matic</a>. This is a web form page that will create a very simple starting FOAF file for you. Don't put any information in it that you don't want to be public, and skip the section on "people you know". When it asks for your email address, make sure to enter it in all lower-case. When completed, it will look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
  xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">
  &lt;foaf:Person>
    &lt;foaf:name>Christopher Allen&lt;/foaf:name>
    &lt;foaf:title>Mr&lt;/foaf:title>
    &lt;foaf:firstName>Christopher&lt;/foaf:firstName>
    &lt;foaf:surname>Allen&lt;/foaf:surname>
    &lt;foaf:nick>Chris&lt;/foaf:nick>
    &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum>9ee1c03552f22e89592ce583be0ab8db0c4f2c59&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
    &lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/>
    &lt;foaf:depiction
      rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/images/ChristopherAllen(100x100).gif"/>
    &lt;foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com"/>
    &lt;foaf:workInfoHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/>
  &lt;/foaf:Person>
&lt;/rdf:RDF></pre></blockquote>
<p>The next thing is to add pointers to any other FOAF files that you might have on other services, for instance, I have a profile on Marc Canter's <a href="http://peopleaggregator.com/">People Aggregator</a> service. You should also list the place where you plan on making your FOAF file available -- you might think that this is a circular reference, but it is OK. My convention is to put the most "authoritative" FOAF file last, so that if there is a conflict the last one might override earlier ones. However, in practice I've not found that any FOAF tool I've used supports this convention. Put these right above the closing <code>&lt;/foaf:Person><code> tag.</p>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=102" />
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=network&amp;amp;op=foafrdf&amp;amp;uid=42230" />
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf" />
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now upload your file to your own web site, and then run your FOAF file through two different validators, the first being the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/">W3C RDF Validation Service</a>. It will tell you if you've made any mistakes with the RDF aspect of the file. Then use <a href="http://sw1.ilrt.org/discovery/2003/08/validation/">Rosco</a> which will also look at your schema and make recommendations as to missing items. Unfortunately, neither validator is very good at telling you what the problem is if it finds one -- again, it is like the old hand-coding HTML days when you are debugging your web pages.</p>

<p>Once you've got your basic FOAF file working, now to enter your friends. First, add to your <code>foaf:Person</code> the following:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:knows rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"/>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This is a pointer that says "look in this document for a person with the <code>rdf:nodeID</code> of MarcCanter". You can invent any value you want for this ID, mcanter, mark, canter, etc., however, it must be a unique ID on this page.</p>

<p>Then fill out the following template for each person, putting below your own <code>foaf:Person</code> but above the closing <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="">
  &lt;foaf:name>&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:firstname>&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:surname>&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:nick>&lt;/foaf:nick>
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum>&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="" />
&lt;/foaf:Person>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>So for instance with Marc Canter:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter">
  &lt;foaf:name>Marc Canter&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum>41e872618d70ba18a7af715083f522afe7fc3238&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=4" />
&lt;/foaf:Person>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now <code>foaf:firstname</code>, <code>foaf:surname</code>, and <code>foaf:nick</code> are not absolutely essential -- you can remove them if they are not needed. I tend to only use them when there might be some confusion, for instance, for "Arthur De Boies" has "De Boise" is a surname, and "Lori Ann Miller" has "Lori Ann" as a firstname. <code>foaf:nick</code> is useful in situatations where there is a dimunitive involved, for instance "Christopher Allen" has "Chris" as a nick, and <code>foaf:nick</code> is also used by some programs online personas or for IRC chat, such as "ChristopherA".</p>

<p>Now where did the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> come from? The purpose of this number is to obscure the email address so that it can't be harvested by spammers, yet is unique enough that it can FOAF-based applications can find people. To convert an email address to a <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> you can use <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/">sha1ify</a>. Just enter the email address that you want converted in all lower case, and copy the string it generates to the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can search and see if any existing FOAF profiles exist for your friend at <a href="http://eikeon.com/foaf/">FOAF: Web View</a>, using their email address. If the friend does have a FOAF file, add it to <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> tag.</p>

<p>When you are done, test your FOAF file with the two validators, and if it works. One common problem that the validators will fail to give you a good error message about is if any of the URLs you use contain any improper characters like &amp; - in particular, Ecademy's FOAF files use this character. Just substitute &amp;amp; for every occurrence of &amp; and it should work fine. Another problem is if any of your friends have international characters in their names, for instance "Sébastien". To avoid this problem, put the following at the top of your FOAF file above your <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag.</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once everything is working you can submit it to services like <a href="http://eikeon.com/foaf/">FOAF: Web View</a>. You can also browse your FOAF file directly by using <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/">FOAF Explorer</a>, or import it into services like <a href="http://peopleaggregator.com">People Aggregator</a>.</p>

<p>Once your FOAF file is working and submitted, you'll want to add an "auto-discovery" meta-tag to your blog or home page. This is placed in the <code>head</code> portion of your HTML code:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml"
  title="FOAF" href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf"/>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you are using TypePad, it forces you to use their FOAF file for you unless you used an Advanced Template. With an Advanced Template you can remove the following tags and replace it with the above:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;MTUserIfShow field="foaf">
  &lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="&lt;$MTUserSiteURL$>foaf.rdf" />
  &lt;/MTUserIfShow>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>From this point on it is just a matter of looking at other people's FOAF files and seeing if you want to add any of the other profile properties that they use. I'm trying to keep a well documented foaf at <a href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf">http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf</a>, and I also recommend looking at Morten Frederiksen's FOAF at <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf">http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf</a> which supports far more profile information then my FOAF does.</p>

<p>Also useful is the IRC chat channel at irc.freenode.net #foaf -- I got a lot of useful tips and advice there.</p>

                                <p>A fascinating series of blog entries shows the promise and peril of social software and Blogs as a medium in a male-dominated technocracy:</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.misbehaving.net/2004/02/sexist_jokes_an.html">misbehaving.net: "sexist jokes and Orkut invites"</a>, Dana Boyd writes:<blockquote>When i received this note, i simultaneously recognized the intended joke and felt the shudder of being so blatantly seen as an object.</blockquote>At <a href="http://radiofreeblogistan.com/2004/02/04/this_social_software_stuff_is_tricky.html">Radio Free Blogistan: "This social software stuff is tricky"</a> Christian Crumlish apologizes:<blockquote>In my mind, I was cracking on the phenomenon of me being linked to so many other men. I wasn't sure if this had something to do with the population of Orkut or with my own subnetwork there.</p>

<p>However, by using language that divided up men and women in terms of visual appeal or attractiveness, I totally slipped over the line. What might be taken as irreverant and ironic by my "real" friends, who are probably somewhat likely to give me the benefit of the doubt and have other inputs to use in order to judge my character or values, in this context managed to hurt danah's feelings: the last thing I would have wanted to do.</p>

<p>What I crossed over into was that "unwelcome gaze" issue, not unlike in one of danah's earliest posts to misbehaving in which she wrote about being invited to a coed hot-tub party by a professional colleague and finding that uncomfortable as well.</blockquote><br />
In <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/05/publicly_processing_hurt.html">Apophenia "Publically Processing Hurt</a>, Dana responds:<blockquote>Don't get me wrong: i'm not screamingly upset. Frankly, i was far more nervous and concerned about posting the damn thing than going through the situation. But i wanted to lay out the experience, the emotions for others to read and understand. Not because i had worried myself sick or magnified the situation out of proportion. It was a situation, it would pass, but maybe some good would come out of posting it for others to see. It is the raw emotions, the logic in our heads that bring us to a situation. We rarely make this visible. For those who don't understand, the goal isn't to give you fodder to attack. Instead, try understanding what life from my perspective might look like. </p>

<p>And then the unexpected happened. Bless his heart, the owner of said comment made a public apology. He didn't need to own up to that statement, but he did. And he went on to offer his emotional reaction to my tinge of hurt. And he continued on to defend both me, my post and my sense of humor (ah, yes, public support is the quickest way to make me respect someone). So, i'm floored. And surprised. And terribly appreciative.</blockquote>I have some understanding of Christian -- I consider myself a conscious feminist, but sometimes our male world-view sets us up for a clash. I could easily see myself in his situation, realizing that there are so few women among my connections, trying to fix that, and then falling flat on my face.</p>

<p>I've run into this type of thing before at <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a> -- one of our games <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/">Castle Marrach</a> is notable as a commercial game that has probably more women involved in it then men. This was a deliberate part of the game design, but when I talk about how and why we designed it that way it is easy for me to come across as sexist.</p>

<p>Also, the context is important. If this 'joke' had been spoken and in a semi-private medium where everyone knows and trusts each other, it would have come across very differently. Instead, it was sent to a circle of friends where everyone knew Christian, but not everyone knew each other. This is more proof that even 'friends of friends' can be a pretty distant connection. If the joke had been told at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">Live Journal</a>, which is also dominated by women (64%), it also would have come across differently.</p>

<p>I'm even uncomfortable writing this blog entry, because no matter what I do, there is no way I can precisely understand what it is like to be in Dana's place, or any women's place for that matter. All I can do is empathize with Dana discomfort and try to not make such mistakes myself.<br />

                                <p>For the last few weeks I've been moving my blog from Blogger Pro over to the TypePad service, after a frustrating try to get WordPress to work. While I was at it, I moved my blog from my business server to this new domain.</p>

<p>I finally have it all working here now, but all of my old permalinks are broken. In progress is a utility that will redirect people from the old permalinks to the new. I'll report progress on that later.<br />

<p>So far seems interesting -- in addition to spell checking and handling some html related tasks, it appears to also have the ability to work with various plugins, for instance, a Windows Media Player plugin to display what music I'm playing right now.</p>

<p> <div class="media">[Listening to: Crimson (4-4) - Solace - Ahsas (04:15)]</div><br />
Stuart says that one of his favorite features is that the tool will post to multiple blogs at once, which is useful if you are maintaining a business and a non-business blog and yet some items will go into both.</p>

                                <p>I have been hesitating on committing to <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> because ever time I check into availability of Blogger Pro, it was not available. Apparently now <a href="http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/pro_email.pyra">Blogger Pro is Free</a>.</p>

<p>My remaining concern is that the <a href="http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/announcement.pyra">new feature list</a> for Blogger Pro does not mention RSS syndication at all, nor does it mention if it will be available in the future. There is a help item for for Syndication, however, it refers to a "Site Feed" tab on my settings panel, and that item is not available.</p>

<p>If RSS syndication is not available soon, I will likely switch to some other software, in spite of the ease of Blogger Pro.</p>

                                <p>I decided after years of reading blogs that it was time to start blogging.</p>

<p>Why Blogger? I wanted an easy web interface, but also I wanted it hosted on my site (which is <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> based). A couple of blog tools offer this. I wanted something really simple and I didn't want to host my own tools (keeping my own TWiki's up-to-date has been a pain) so I wanted the tools hosted elsewere. I also required that the remote tools used a secure connection to my server -- Blogger uses SFTP.</p>

<p>But the clincher was the new <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>My only SNAFU so far is that I've got my new <a href="http://twiki.alacritymanagement.com/bin/view/Kitchen">Kitchen TWiki</a> working to send and receive RSS, however, the signup for <a href="http://pro.blogger.com/">Blogger Pro</a> has the note "Blogger Pro ordering is currently offline while we retool. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please check back next week."</p>
