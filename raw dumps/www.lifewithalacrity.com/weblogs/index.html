<p>The goal of this portion of the class is to&#0160;cover an introduction and overview of the landscape of the Social Web, establish among the students the beginning of a shared language about the medium, and introduce a process toward a collaborative culture that we will use for the rest of the course. Students are also kicking off their Beat blogs on sustainability topics, with the goal of helping them move toward having an authentic online voice.</p>

<p><strong>TOPIC: Shared Language</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language. They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience.</em><br /></strong></p>

<li>KEYQUOTE: “Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something…However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact…It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: &quot;Is this what you mean when…&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Why don&#39;t people just say what they mean? The reason is that conversational partners are not modems downloading information into each other&#39;s brains. People are very, very touchy about their relationships. Whenever you speak to someone, you are presuming the two of you have a certain degree of familiarity--which your words might alter. So every sentence has to do two things at once: convey a message and continue to negotiate that relationship.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Shared Language is a prerequisite to collaboration. Without Shared Language, we can’t collaborate. It’s as simple as that. When a group tries to collaborate without having Shared Language, the group will try to create it, whether it’s aware of it or not. This creation process is often frustrating and painful, and as a result, people sometimes try to skip this step or belittle the process. This is a problem. You can’t skip this step.&quot;</li>

We&#39;re just in the early stages of the enabling technology to make that happen, how to make that happen technically, and how to make it happen socially so that we can use our social networks and use our groups as a foundation for doing really interesting, productive, and creative things.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;The term &#39;social software&#39;, which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush&#39;s ideas about &#39;memex&#39; in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. By examining the many terms used to describe today&#39;s &#39;social software&#39; we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how there exists a very real life cycle concerning the use of technical terminology.&quot;</li>

<li>QUOTE: &quot;Social media has become an integral part of modern society.&#0160;There are general social networks with user bases larger than the population of most countries. There are niche sites for virtually every special interest out there. There are sites to share photos, videos, status updates, sites for meeting new people and sites to connect with old friends. It seems there are social solutions to just about every need. In this article, we’ll review the history and evolution of social media from its humble beginnings to the present day.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Be Safe: None of these approaches is perfect, but they significantly raise the bar against any but the most determined cracker from breaking into one of your accounts. The domain letter technique will also make it very difficult for a cracker to break into your more important financial accounts if he gets access to your password from a poorly secured website or masquerades as a legitimate website or email by using a phishing attack.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot; Scientists say juggling e-mail, phone calls and other incoming information can change how people think and behave. They say our ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information. These play to a primitive impulse to respond to immediate opportunities and threats. The stimulation provokes excitement — a dopamine squirt — that researchers say can be addictive. In its absence, people feel bored.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;My thoughts have now gelled sufficiently to make some observations about privacy. When people speak about privacy, they may actually be talking about very different forms of privacy: defensive privacy, human-rights privacy, personal privacy, and contextual privacy.&quot;</li>

<li>ABSTRACT: &quot;How much information is really being collected about you? How is it being used? And could it fall into the wrong hands?&#0160;To find out, we queried Facebook and interviewed some two dozen others, including security experts, privacy lawyers, app developers, and victims of security and privacy abuse. We dug into private, academic, and government research, as well as Facebook’s labyrinthian policies and controls. And we surveyed 2,002 online households, including 1,340 that are active on Facebook, for our annual State of the Net report. We then projected those data to estimate national totals.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;It is easy to become unsettled by privacy-eroding aspects of awareness tools. But there is another — quite different — result of all this incessant updating: a culture of people who know much more about themselves. Many of the avid Twitterers, Flickrers and Facebook users I interviewed described an unexpected side-effect of constant self-disclosure. The act of stopping several times a day to observe what you’re feeling or thinking can become, after weeks and weeks, a sort of philosophical act. It’s like the Greek dictum to “know thyself,” or the therapeutic concept of mindfulness. (Indeed, the question that floats eternally at the top of Twitter’s Web site — “What are you doing?” — can come to seem existentially freighted. What are you doing?) Having an audience can make the self-reflection even more acute, since, as my interviewees noted, they’re trying to describe their activities in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting to others: the status update as a literary form.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Think about how the trendy, jargon, national, and regional references you use in your blog may be misunderstood or even confuse your blog readers. It’s critical for bloggers to be “understood”, so take time to look at what you write and how your writing may create a disconnect with your readers.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;One thing we should keep in mind when writing here or in any online forum is that we are writing not only for the present, but for the future. Our words may well be read many times, even far into the future. They are recorded in public and private archives and will be available indefinitely. Given the likely increase in future levels of intelligence and attention, it may even turn out that more eyes see our writings in the far future than in the near present.&quot;</li>

                                <p>This blog has been quiet lately as I've been doing a lot of work in the last year on the iPhone. I've been speaking at conferences like eComm 2008 (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eComm2008/christopher-allens-presentation-at-ecomm-2008">presentation</a>, <a href="http://blogs.nmscommunications.com/communications/2008/05/heres-the-compl.html">video from panel</a>), writing an book on the iPhone with my co-author Shannon Appelcline called <a href="http://www.manning.com/callen">iPhone in Action: Introduction to Web and SDK Development</a> (first <a href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/callen/callen_meapch1-2.pdf">two chapters</a> free</a>), and I am one of the organizers for the upcoming <a href="http://www.iPhoneDevCamp.org">iPhoneDevCamp 2</a>, a MacHack style conference on August 1st-3rd, and I am working on some social software apps for the iPhone.</p>

<p>I've been reluctant to post too many of these off posts on this blog, as I like the length, quality and high-signal-to-noise ratio of the posts that I've written for this blog. I do plan to continue to offer more social software and social media posts, including followups to my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">Collective Choice</a> articles, as well as updates on my popular <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> posts. But I don't want to spam my readers here with notes on iPhone Apps, my thoughts on movies, circuses, the odd conferences I speak at, etc.</p>

So far I have posted:<p><ul ><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/max-9-pages-thu.html">Max 9 pages, thus Max 144 Apps on iPhone OS 2.0</a></li><li ><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/first-look-at-a.html">First Look at AirMe App for iPhone</a></li><li ><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/trying-out-type.html">Trying Out TypePad's Blog It Web App</a></li><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/iphone-typepa-1.html">iPhone TypePad App Second Pass</a></li><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/iphone-typepad.html">iPhone TypePad App First Look</a></li><li><a href="http://ephemera.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/07/ephemera-blog.html">Ephemera Blog</a></li></ul></p></p>

<p>My presentation is an offshoot of an odd sideline of mine, executive blog and social web coaching. Basically, many times over the last couple of years I've been asked by colleagues and friends to help them with the social web. I've always been honored to spend the time to teach them how to blog, better manage the noise of the web by using a feed reader, how to participate in social networks, and how to improve their personal brand.</p>

<p>Increasingly, the social network of their peers is now asking me to help them to do the same for them. So I've been doing this more and more over the last year on a consulting basis as their social networks appear to be saying saying that I have a lot to offer.</p>

<p>I've twice now been out to Cincinnati where I've been working with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/5/3a9/480">Drew Boyd</a> at Johnson & Johnson, where I've been coaching him on his blog and personal brand. He has been blogging now for almost six months at <a href="http://www.innovationinpractice.com/">Innovation in Practice</a> with some success. Now he is referring me to other executives at Johnson & Johnson who need similar coaching, or need strategic advice on how to deal with specific social web initiatives within Johnson & Johnson.</p>

<p>Most recently, Drew has asked me to join him in Seoul to speak at the Global Forum, which is a worldwide gathering of executive trainers. There I am presenting a synopsis of what I teach, and how they can begin to learn how to teach their staff how to do the same. My trip has been sponsored by Johnson & Johnson, so it has been a lot of fun to be here. I get to both dive into deep discussions of methodologies for teaching inside business, as well as learn about the Korean and other international business cultures and how they are different from the United States.</p>

<p>During the evenings I've had a chance to wander the streets of downtown Seoul. It is very different then wandering though streets in Europe, not only because of the different culture and language, but also because all of the signs are in Hangul, the korean character set. Very few signs use the roman alphabet, so it is often very difficult to figure out what is what without walking in. Like Japan, there are some signs in English to represent a brand or a style, but not many. Even China has more signs in English then Korean's do -- the last time I was there I was surprised by how almost every important sign was in both Chinese and English, so much so I was beginning to learn Chinese language characters just by association! Despite the language problems everyone is nice and it feels safe to wander in these neighborhoods.</p>

<p>I return on Monday, and I'll make a copy of my final presentation available here.</p>

                                <p>My colleague, <a href="http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline.php">Shannon Appelcline</a>, has been working on a game rating system for <a href="http://www.rpg.net">RPGnet</a>. This has resulted in real-world application of the principles for designing rating systems which we've previously discussed in our <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/collective_choi.html">Collective Choice</a> articles. Shannon's newest article, <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_196.phtml">Ratings,
Who Do You Trust?</a> offers a look at weighting ratings based on reliability.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/shannon_appelcline.jpg" title="Shannon_appelcline" alt="Shannon_appelcline" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></p><blockquote><p><em>On the <a href="http://index.rpg.net/">RPGnet Gaming Index</a> we've put this all together to form a tree of weighted ratings that answer the question, <em>who do you trust</em>?</em></p>

<p><em>Here's how we measured each type of trust, and what we did about it:</em></p>

<ul><li><p><em><strong>Volume of Ratings for an Item.</strong> Introduce a bayesian weight to offset the variability of items with low-volume ratings.</em></p></li>

<li><p><em><strong>Volume of Ratings by a User.</strong> Give each user a weight based on his volume of contribution which is applied to his ratings.</em></p>
</li>

<li><p><em><strong>Depth of Content by a User.</strong> Give each rating a weight based on the depth of thought implicit in the rating which is applied to that rating.</em></p>
</li></ul>

<p><em>These all get put together to create our final ratings for
the Gaming Index, with each user's individual rating for an item
getting multiplied by its user weight and its content weight, and then
all of that averaged with the other user ratings and the bayesian
weight too. The result is in no way intuitive, but users don't really
need to understand the back end of a rating system. Conversely we hope
it's accurate, or at least more accurate than would otherwise be true
given the relatively low volume of ratings we've collected thus far.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some of Shannon's earlier discussions about the design behind the new &quot;user content&quot; based <a href="http://index.rpg.net">RPGnet Gaming Index</a>:</p>

User Creativity</a> - A look at the &quot;XP&quot; system which has helped to incentivize the creation of the database at the heart of the ratings.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_193.phtml">Managing User Creativity, Part Two</a> - An examination of the nuts and bolts of RPGnet's Gaming Index database.

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For the last several months I've been working on a new open source project that I've been calling <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>. SynchroEdit is a browser-based simultaneous multiuser editor, useful for <a href="http://www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/rng/teaching/notes/CSCWgroupware.html">&quot;same-time&quot; collaboration</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/synchroeditmac.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=493,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="262" height="202" border="0" alt="Synchroeditmac" title="Synchroeditmac" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/synchroeditmac.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The basic concept is that it allows multiple users to WYSIWYG edit a single web-based document, all at exactly the same time. SynchroEdit continuously synchronizes all changes so that users always see the same version. They can also see each others' changes as they type, see where each user is currently editing, and see each others' changes by color.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is a tool for &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration, either &quot;same-time, different-place&quot;, as in teleconference calls, or &quot;same-time, same-place&quot;, during a meeting or a conference. If you've ever used <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> on Mac OS X, or <a href="http://www.moonedit.com">MoonEdit</a> for Windows or Linux, or the cross-platform <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/">Gobby</a>, this is a similar experience. The difference is that unlike those tools you are not limited to just plain text -- character styles (bold, italic, etc.) and paragraph styles (rulers, headers, blockquotes, etc) are synchronized as well. And of course, it all works inside your browser.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is inspired by my frustration with the lack of an easily accessible cross-platform simultaneous editor. Many times when I've been on the phone with a colleague discussing a draft blog entry, or demonstrating some code, or on a teleconference call with others to discuss a proposal or a standard, or at a conference taking notes with others, I've wanted to have this tool. The rare occasions that we all have been on the same platform and have been able to use an existing tool have demonstrated to me the value of having a good simultaneous editor. Having SynchroEdit available will make it easier for people to have these positive collaborative experiences.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have a long history with &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration tools -- back in 1988 I was briefly executive producer at Broderbund for a same-time groupware product called <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1cDDTqwlqGoJ:www.the-scientist.com/yr1988/jul/software_p22_880725.html+%2Bbroderbund+%2B%22for+comment%22+groupware">For Comment</a>. Unfortunately, the success of the Nintendo game console forced Broderbund to drop all of their non-consumer product efforts. In the early 90's I worked on several different &quot;same-time same-place&quot; groupware tools for live meetings. Most recently, my game company <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos Tech</a>, created several browser-based &quot;enhanced chat&quot; clients for playing in MUSH-like storytelling games, which are also &quot;same-time&quot;.</p>



<p>I personally believe that that this capability should be a fundamental feature of the web, sort of the obvious extension of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee's</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4132752.stm">vision</a> of the editable web. Thus my desire to offer this tool as open source, allowing anyone to add this capability to their own software (unlike proprietary editor services such as <a href="http://www.jotlive.com">JotLive</a> or <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>).</p>



<p>The challenge with offering SynchroEdit as open source is finding a business model -- unlike an application like <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> or a service like <a href="http://www.jotlive.com">JotLive</a>, it is difficult to get revenues from individual users. Instead, we ask for contributions from companies that might find the tool useful, we offer consulting to customize it for specific purposes, and we give these companies public credit for their contributions to the common good.</p>

<p>The first company to step up to the plate is <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a>, an enterprise wiki company. Clearly, being able to offer this capability to their customers will give them added value, and they already have a history of using open source with their support of <a href="http://www.kwiki.org/">Kwiki</a> and <a href="http://www.wikiwyg.net/">Wikiwyg</a>.</p>

<p>The second supporter is venture capitalist and blogger <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joichi Ito</a>. He is is particularly well known for his own experiments with &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration. He runs a continuous #joiito IRC chat room, active 24 hours a day with hundreds of his friends. He also has done many live &quot;same-time&quot; experiments with chat backchannel during his talks at various conferences.</p>

<p>In addition to to financial support of SocialText and Joichi Ito, I have some offers of help from the <a href="http://www.bgiedu.org">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>, who plan to use it in its socially responsible and environmentally sustainable MBA program, and we've also taken advantage of some code developed by <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a>.</p>

<p>The development of SynchroEdit is being led by Kalle Alm, a young Swedish coder I met when he was creating an online game at Skotos. Skotos has long had the vision of having games created by its members, and Kalle Alm was the first member to create a game completely from scratch using Skotos' tools.</p>

<p>We are seeking more financial contributions so that we can accelerate development. Currently SynchroEdit only works in Mozilla/Firefox, and I anticipate that making it work with Internet Explorer may be quite difficult, so we'll need more partners to help.</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more, visit the <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit website</a>. We have additional information on the program, a <a href="http://wiki.synchroedit.com">developers wiki</a>, as well as a sandbox that you can play in to demonstrate SynchroEdit in use.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <blockquote><dl><dt><em><strong>Extrapolate</strong></em></dt><dd><em>To infer an unknown from something that is known; conjecture.</em><span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><br />-- The Random House College Dictionary</span></dd></dl></blockquote>

<p><a href="mailto:mlasalle@sfchronicle.com">Mick LaSalle</a>, an acerbic movie reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, writes a regular column &quot;Ask Mick LaSalle&quot; in the Sunday paper, where he sometimes allows others to vent their displeasure at his movie reviews. In this week's <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/17/PKGJNCETV81.DTL">column</a> he says something that I find very accurate to my experience with the online medium:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As for why people get hostile when they hear a differing opinion, I go back to Spinoza's definition of love and hatred. He says that people love that which they think reinforces their survival and hate that which they think threatens their survival. I believe -- this is just my humble theory, now -- that when people hear an opinion that counters theirs, their minds extrapolate from that one opinion to imagine a whole philosophical system. And then they imagine how they would fare in a world run according to that imagined system. So they go from disagreeing to feeling threatened in a matter of seconds, and they lash out. Often they write letters that begin, &quot;You are obviously,&quot; and that's where they identify, not you, but the phantom they feel threatened by.</em></p>

<p><em>Over the years, I've been &quot;obviously&quot; liberal, conservative, gay, straight, humorless, frivolous, angry and deeply jealous of Tom Hanks. When I was 30, I remember getting accused of being a 45-year-old former hippie who drove a BMW, wore a Rolex and had done acid in the '60s. I'm not sure if I wrote back, but if I did, I would have said, &quot;Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.&quot; But, of course, that kind of letter is your key to acquiring distance. It lets you know that the person's real quarrel is with some middle-aged former hippie -- probably known as Dad -- and that you're just the vehicle for that day's projection.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I think that Mick LaSalle is exactly right -- I've seen this type of hostility based on extrapolation regularly in online mediums: in emails, newsgroups, wikis, blogs, etc. I've been guilty of it a few times myself, though usually for me the result is that I don't respond at all -- &quot;Oh, he is just a flaming liberal&quot;, &quot;She's an arch-conservative&quot; or &quot;He is a just a technophobe.&quot; I can then feel comfortable in ignoring the rest of his or her point of view rather then trying to understand it.</p>

<p>I doubt if explaining this theory to someone who writes a hostile message is useful -- they will take it as yet another attack, which will likely contribute to another cycle of flamage. But I do find Mick's theory useful as another way to read and understand hostile messages, and respond more appropriately.</p>

<p>Understanding this lets me add another widget to my social software toolbox: when a group process results in a hostile message, try to determine if the author is actually reacting to what you said or if their hostility is based on extrapolating to &quot;obvious&quot; generalities. This may not allow you to directly address the hostility, but it may help you better understand it and thus not contribute to the cycle of flames.</p>

                                <p>If you read my blog through an aggregator, you may not have noticed my new sidebar &quot;Recent Bookmarks&quot;. It is a list of web pages that I've found interesting enough to annotate using the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> service. It is useful if you want to have an insight into what future blog entries I'm working on, as links will often show up there before my actual blog posting is out.</p>

<p>You alternatively can <a href="http://del.icio.us/ChristopherA?setcount=10">view my last 10 del.icio.us postings</a>, or subscribe to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/ChristopherA">del.icio.us RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in offering this feature in your own blog, I used the <a href="http://www.bigbold.com/rssdigest/">RSS Digest</a> webservice to create a javascript applet that formats information from my del.icio.us RSS feed into a format suitable for my sidebar. There are a lot of other cool things that are possible with this service.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I've been working on an ambitious list of topics that I'd like to cover over the next year. I offer them to you here so you can have some idea the areas that I am thinking about.</p>

<p><strong><em>Office Architecture for Innovation</em></strong> -- Over the years I've built or converted three offices to my specifications. From this I have learned a number of things about about how to create a productive environment innovation-oriented businesses. These include some of the obvious suggestions such as fresh air and natural light, but also include not so obvious ideas such as using magnetic paint and providing a small washer-dryer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Requisite Variety</em></strong> -- This concept from cybernetics applies to social systems as well. &quot;The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate.&quot; More people, as well as a diversity of thinking styles and experience, give social software more &quot;variety of actions&quot;, thus this is part of the reason why social software can be so effective.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Art and Craft of Meme Design</em></strong> -- We are learning more about how to create an effective meme. Creating memes has always been an art performed by publicists, marketers, politicians, the press, and to a lesser extent by scientists and other academics. Have we learned enough to turn this art into an explicit craft?</p>

<p><strong><em>Wiki Editing Dichotomy</em></strong> -- One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the &quot;wiki editing dichotomy&quot;. You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don't know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.</p>

<p><strong><em>Choice &amp; Neuroeconomics</em></strong> -- There are some that say at the root of every decision is emotion. Even a 'rational' decision appeals to a sense of balance or beauty. Recent studies using PET are establishing a neurological basis for emotions, and some reveal interesting facts about how we make choices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Assessing Risk</em></strong> -- There are a variety of areas where we as humans have a difficult time being completely rational. One of these is risk assessment. It turns out we may be hard-wired to not be able toeasily understand risk that is greater then one in a hundred or so. Thus a very rare risk, say one in a thousand, will often be emotionally interpreted as having a much higher risk.</p>


<p><strong><em>Persuasive Computing</em></strong> -- BJ Fogg's group at Stanford has done some interesting research on how computers can persuade you to do something. There are a number of useful ideas that come from this research. There are also some ethical considerations that should be discussed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cognitive Dissonance</em></strong> -- This technique is central to many forms of persuasion intended to change beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors. It is used by facilitators, businesses, military organizations, and even cults. It can be used positively or negatively. How might it be used in social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>The Dark Side of the Force</em></strong> -- The same social tools that we use for good, can also be used for harm. How do we ethically use what we are learning about social software? Some say that almost by definition social software attracts spammers, trolls, and innappropriate sexuality. What can we do to prevent these misuses of social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Conversation vs Communication</em></strong> -- Update and rewrite of my <a href="http://www.alacritymanagement.com/GCnC.html">1990 essay</a> on how social software design needs to balance conversation vs communication.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Emotions</em></strong> -- We appear to have evolved a number of emotions that appear primarily to exist to support a common good, rather then to ensure our individual success. These include schadenfreude, mirth, naches, revenge, shame, pride, outrage, approbation, admiration, elevation, etc. Studies by Eckman on unconscious facial gestures, studies on the neurological basis for emotions, and studies on emotions in games, are proving that these social emotions exist. A number of them have interesting implications on social software.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glances &amp; Strokes</em></strong> -- There is some old work on the amount of eye contact we make with others in small groups, as well as some research from transactional analysis on strokes, which are the amount of recognition given to others through words and deeds. Is there a neurological basis for needing a certain number of glances and strokes each day? How does this concept apply to social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Weak Links</em></strong> -- There are some interesting social implications behind what we've learned about weak links in social networks. How do we identify and encourage weak links in our social software systems?</p>

<p><strong><em>Negativity vs Positivity</em></strong> -- It is far easier for someone to respond negativel than positively. In political systems it is far easier to say no rather then yes. What social software encourages positivity, and is it possible to design social software to do so?</p>

<p><strong><em>Time Economy</em></strong> -- Our ultimate most unrenewable resource is time. How time and attention are a basic economic unit that should be considered when looking at social software.</p>


<p><strong><em>Group Life Cycle</em></strong> -- We often focus on how groups form, emerge, and grow. Yet there are many lessons to be learned from how groups die, including that it isn't necessarily a bad thing and that keeping a group from death can be dysfunctional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Groupthink</em></strong> -- What causes groupthink? When is it good and when is it bad?</p>


<p><strong><em>Two Thresholds in the Value of Knowledge</em></strong> -- In order for knowledge to be valuable, it must at minimum be more valuable then the costs to find and absorb it (costs which include bandwidth and attention). Tools like Google have tremendously increased the amount of knowledge that is worth the time and attention to find it. What types of knowledge fall below this threshold of value? Is there a limit to how much we can lower this line? Furthermore, there is another threshold where the knowledge is significantly more valuable than only bandwidth and attention. How much have internet tools impacted this second threshold? Many internet business models, in particular content models, require some ability to offer value in this upper threshold -- can they survive as this upper threshold changes?</p>

<p><strong><em>Intimacy and Social Networks</em></strong> -- Social Networks Analysis tends to focus on the connections between people, either explicitly through acknowledgement of connections (LinkedIn, Friendster) or implicitly through analysis of your communication (Spoke). None are able to measure intimacy. Yet our intimate social networks are an important component of our overall happiness and contentment within both our professional and personal lives. How does intimacy work in social networks? Also there are some concepts in psychology known as communal vs exchange relationships by Clark &amp; Mills from late 70's that may apply here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Games</em></strong> -- A recap of Shannon Appelcline's and my analysis of the basic forms of social games types. These include relatively well understood ones like majority control, voting, meta-voting (Nomic), auctioning, etc., but also include less well understood games like playing of roles, dominance and submission, etc. There are also links to social emotions, such as mirth and schadenfraude.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Castle Marrach</em></strong> -- We released the Castle Marrach online game in September of 2000, and it was designed from the beginning to be a game for the Bartle-type known as &quot;the socializer&quot;. What lessons did we learn in the five years since the release of the game? What tools are in my social software toolbox today that might have helped with the design?</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from F2F Facilitation</em></strong> -- There are many skilled practitioners of face-to-face facilitation, some of which are paid very high fees for their skills. What lessons can we learn from their experience that we can apply to social software? Why have so many of these facilitators failed to have success online?</p>

<p><strong><em>More Human vs More Than Human</em></strong> -- Many futurists seek to offer us augmentation of our minds and bodies through technology. Many of these ideas may fundamentally change what it is to be human, and may even have unforeseen complications unanticipated by their creators. One interesting approach to looking at these technologies is to examine which make us &quot;more human&quot;, rather then &quot;more than human&quot;.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Mental Disorders</em></strong> -- Most, if not all, mental disorders have their roots in survival strategies; however, they are over-expressed because of genetic or other causes. Examining the healthy behaviors hiding behind depression, autism, mania, schizophrenia, paranoia, etc. offer a number of insights on how we think.</p>

<p><strong><em>Joy of being a Primate</em></strong> -- If you scan the surface of my writing, you may observe that I have a strong belief that our animal nature and genetics form an essential and often unconscious part of what it is to be human. You could interpret these &quot;nature&quot; over &quot;nurture&quot; ideas as limiting us to being just animals. Instead, I believe that by becoming aware of our primate nature, and choosing to leverage it or suppress it by conscious choice rather then letting it drive us unaware, is what makes us more powerful.</p>

<p><strong><em>Smart Contracts</em></strong> -- Nick Szabo popularized the idea of using some of the primitives of cryptography in unique ways to create what he calls &quot;smart contracts&quot;. He hypothesized approaches to cryptographic handling of collateral, bonding, delineation of property, bearer certificates, and much more. Others have proposed various auction protocols using these concepts. One of the fundamental atomic elements of many of these smart contracts is something called a &quot;reusable proof of work&quot;, which Hal Finney recently demoed a version of at CodeCon 2005. What are the possibilities offered by smart contracts? What are the barriers to implementation?</p>

<p><strong><em>Club System</em></strong> -- In the 80's, development of Ted Nelson's Xanadu vision was being financed by Autodesk. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons Xanadu failed to deliver any technology. However, a couple of their ideas could be valuable today, one of which is the concept of an alternative to the &quot;user and groups&quot; metaphor for computer security. Xanadu turned that idea upside down and called the result the &quot;club system&quot;. The club system approach is particularly suited to the internet based collaboration tools, in particular wikis. I also have some insights to offer a cryptographic approach to the club system, which might allow P2P distribution of collaborative documents, while preserving group privileges.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edges of Cryptographic Security</em></strong> -- The SSL cryptographic protocol offers a choice of a number of security properties: integrity, confidentiality, encryption, one-party authentication, and two-party authentication. But there are a number of security properties that very few deployed cryptographic protocols offer. These include perfect forward secrecy, undeniability, deniability, authorization, delegation, multi-party authentication, shared secrets, etc. What are these security properties and how are they useful? Why have they not been successfully broadly deployed?</p>

<p><strong><em>The SSL Story</em></strong> -- When SSL was first proposed it was broken within an hour. Even when Netscape fixed those problems, it wasn't clear that SSL was going to win the battle of security protocols. SSL was competing against SHTTP which had backing of RSA and an industry consortium. The credit card companies merged their standards and were backing SET. The internet community was moving toward SSH. Microsoft was doing its own embrace and extend protocol PCT. So how did SSL win to become the broadest deployed cryptographic security protocol? The answers may surprise you.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I'm a keynote speaker for the <a href="http://www.nvhainnovations.org/2005/index.htm">FVHA (Future of Voluntary Health Associations) Conference</a>
in Atlanta today. My job is to give to this community a gentle
introduction and overview of concepts and products related to Social
Software and Social Networking. (<a href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/FVHA_Social_Software_Keynote_Presentation.pdf">My slides are here - 6.6MB .pdf</a>)</p>

<p>

In my research about this community, I find that they have some unique and interesting problems.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acsrelay.jpg" title="Acsrelay" alt="Acsrelay" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />

The attendees of this conference are a collection of VPs and national
directors from major Voluntary Health Associations such as American
Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, March of
Dimes, etc. In turn, these Voluntary Health Associations organize
communities in order to raise funds for, and inform the public about
the medical implications for the different health problems that each are
concerned with. These associations have an organized volunteer base of
over five million people and raise in excess of two billion dollars
annually. They all have dedicated and diverse volunteer communities
which include practicing MDs, scientific researchers, health educators,
business executives, and working and nonworking mothers.</p>

<p>

I think it is the quantity of people served, the diversity of their
communities, and in particular, the need to dive deep into information
that makes these Voluntary Health Associations interesting. A women diagnosed
with breast cancer will need to make educated decisions about her own
health care in order to give informed consent. Yet she may not have the
education experience or background to understand the care decisions she
must make. She may not even have a current era computer. There are
few other online communities that need their members to understand so
deeply such difficult problems.</p>

<p>
Thus the desire of these associations to look deeper in to Social
Software. Of course, their key interest is in better understanding,
motivating, and expanding their volunteer networks. They are already
experts in the business of organizing traditional communities, but now
they have to deal with the changing nature of communities as their
members are now using the internet as the primary source of
information.</p>

<p>

Ideally Social Software can help increase their sense of touch with
their volunteers, it can empower volunteers to collaborate and work
harder and in new ways, it can increase information sharing and
innovation, and it can help drive fund-raising numbers higher.</p>

<p>But the
openness of social software comes with a price. For instance, many of
these associations are afraid of enabling even simple unmoderated
discussion lists, in fear that bad or inappropriate information would be shared. There are also legitimate concerns about the quality, audience level, and attributation for even correct information. In the Q&amp;A after my presentation I tried to explain how, when looking at individual blogs, or individual events of info vandalism, it is not really relevant if the communities and processes behind the Social Software are able to correct or filter those events. This is a difficult point to get across, as it requires people to learn to trust a system where the squeaky wheels and trolls are the loudest.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acslogowhite.gif" title="Acslogowhite" alt="Acslogowhite" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />

One particular interesting thing about this conference is that
it is one of the first between multiple associations. I know from some
other non-profits that I'm working with that they often feel in
competition for funds and resources from other non-profits, so I
applaud the American Cancer Society for sponsoring this cross-pollination effort.</p>
