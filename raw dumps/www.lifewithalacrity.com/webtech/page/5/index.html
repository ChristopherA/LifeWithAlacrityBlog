		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For the last several months I've been working on a new open source project that I've been calling <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>. SynchroEdit is a browser-based simultaneous multiuser editor, useful for <a href="http://www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/rng/teaching/notes/CSCWgroupware.html">&quot;same-time&quot; collaboration</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/synchroeditmac.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=493,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="262" height="202" border="0" alt="Synchroeditmac" title="Synchroeditmac" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/synchroeditmac.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The basic concept is that it allows multiple users to WYSIWYG edit a single web-based document, all at exactly the same time. SynchroEdit continuously synchronizes all changes so that users always see the same version. They can also see each others' changes as they type, see where each user is currently editing, and see each others' changes by color.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is a tool for &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration, either &quot;same-time, different-place&quot;, as in teleconference calls, or &quot;same-time, same-place&quot;, during a meeting or a conference. If you've ever used <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> on Mac OS X, or <a href="http://www.moonedit.com">MoonEdit</a> for Windows or Linux, or the cross-platform <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/">Gobby</a>, this is a similar experience. The difference is that unlike those tools you are not limited to just plain text -- character styles (bold, italic, etc.) and paragraph styles (rulers, headers, blockquotes, etc) are synchronized as well. And of course, it all works inside your browser.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is inspired by my frustration with the lack of an easily accessible cross-platform simultaneous editor. Many times when I've been on the phone with a colleague discussing a draft blog entry, or demonstrating some code, or on a teleconference call with others to discuss a proposal or a standard, or at a conference taking notes with others, I've wanted to have this tool. The rare occasions that we all have been on the same platform and have been able to use an existing tool have demonstrated to me the value of having a good simultaneous editor. Having SynchroEdit available will make it easier for people to have these positive collaborative experiences.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have a long history with &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration tools -- back in 1988 I was briefly executive producer at Broderbund for a same-time groupware product called <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1cDDTqwlqGoJ:www.the-scientist.com/yr1988/jul/software_p22_880725.html+%2Bbroderbund+%2B%22for+comment%22+groupware">For Comment</a>. Unfortunately, the success of the Nintendo game console forced Broderbund to drop all of their non-consumer product efforts. In the early 90's I worked on several different &quot;same-time same-place&quot; groupware tools for live meetings. Most recently, my game company <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos Tech</a>, created several browser-based &quot;enhanced chat&quot; clients for playing in MUSH-like storytelling games, which are also &quot;same-time&quot;.</p>



<p>I personally believe that that this capability should be a fundamental feature of the web, sort of the obvious extension of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee's</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4132752.stm">vision</a> of the editable web. Thus my desire to offer this tool as open source, allowing anyone to add this capability to their own software (unlike proprietary editor services such as <a href="http://www.jotlive.com">JotLive</a> or <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>).</p>



<p>The challenge with offering SynchroEdit as open source is finding a business model -- unlike an application like <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> or a service like <a href="http://www.jotlive.com">JotLive</a>, it is difficult to get revenues from individual users. Instead, we ask for contributions from companies that might find the tool useful, we offer consulting to customize it for specific purposes, and we give these companies public credit for their contributions to the common good.</p>

<p>The first company to step up to the plate is <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a>, an enterprise wiki company. Clearly, being able to offer this capability to their customers will give them added value, and they already have a history of using open source with their support of <a href="http://www.kwiki.org/">Kwiki</a> and <a href="http://www.wikiwyg.net/">Wikiwyg</a>.</p>

<p>The second supporter is venture capitalist and blogger <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joichi Ito</a>. He is is particularly well known for his own experiments with &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration. He runs a continuous #joiito IRC chat room, active 24 hours a day with hundreds of his friends. He also has done many live &quot;same-time&quot; experiments with chat backchannel during his talks at various conferences.</p>

<p>In addition to to financial support of SocialText and Joichi Ito, I have some offers of help from the <a href="http://www.bgiedu.org">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>, who plan to use it in its socially responsible and environmentally sustainable MBA program, and we've also taken advantage of some code developed by <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a>.</p>

<p>The development of SynchroEdit is being led by Kalle Alm, a young Swedish coder I met when he was creating an online game at Skotos. Skotos has long had the vision of having games created by its members, and Kalle Alm was the first member to create a game completely from scratch using Skotos' tools.</p>

<p>We are seeking more financial contributions so that we can accelerate development. Currently SynchroEdit only works in Mozilla/Firefox, and I anticipate that making it work with Internet Explorer may be quite difficult, so we'll need more partners to help.</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more, visit the <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit website</a>. We have additional information on the program, a <a href="http://wiki.synchroedit.com">developers wiki</a>, as well as a sandbox that you can play in to demonstrate SynchroEdit in use.</p>

                                <p>In my initial blog entry on the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> I presented some statistics on group sizes based on the online game <a href="http://www.uo.com">Ultimata Online</a>. In it you could clearly see the power-law (pareto) curve, with diminishing returns at around 150, with most groups being 60 in size:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html#onlinecommunities"><img alt="" border="0" height="550" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/UOGuildPowerLaw.jpg" width="814" /></a></p>

<p>More recently, <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/">Nick Yee</a> and other researchers at the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/">PlayOn Blog</a> have been researching the behaviors of players in the popular <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> online game. At my request, they sampled guild sizes over a one-week period, and prepared <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html">similar graphs</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use&#0160;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060205115408/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html">internet archive link</a>)</em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html" onclick="window.open(&#39;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html&#39;,&#39;popup&#39;,&#39;width=925,height=348,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false"></a> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Guildsize" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-800wi" title="Guildsize" /></a></p>

<p>Overall, these statistics still support my original hypothesis in my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> post that mean group sizes will be smaller than 150 for non-survival oriented groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &quot;grooming&quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&#39;t have requisite variety.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the diminishing returns for large groups in <em>World of Warcraft</em> appear to cut off much sooner then they do in <em>Ultima Online</em>, with the 95th percentile 54 and the 99th percentile being 110. When I asked about why the &#39;knee&#39; was much closer to 50 rather than <em>Ultima Online&#39;s </em>knee around 150, <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/">Raph Koster</a> (the game designer who gave me the original <em>Ultima Online</em> data) answered that it might be because <em>Ultima Online</em> used a &quot;veteran member&quot; method of counting. This could result in under reporting of new users and thus pushing up sizes of more established groups.</p>
<p>Also different was the fact that the <em>World of Warcraft</em> guild sizes display a reverse power-law, with the smallest groups being much more common, rather then the bell curve of <em>Ultima Online</em>. If one-person guilds are excluded, the average guild size was 16.8, the median was 9. This seems to correspond much closer to my thoughts on a smaller &#39;nodal&#39; threshold for group size that I&#39;ve observed at around 15, which I describe in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html">Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation</a>.</p>
<p>My guess is that there is something about <em>Worlds of Warcraft</em> such that even participating in very small groups can be useful, whereas for <em>Ultima Online</em> the utility is gained mainly by sharing the resources earned by larger groups. Thus <em>Worlds of Warcraft</em> has groups that are &quot;bands&quot; as well as &quot;tribes&quot;, while with <em>Ultima Online</em> groups are more llikely to be just &quot;tribes&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not had time to play <em>Worlds of Warcraft</em> yet, so I&#39;m curious if those who have more experience would agree with my hypothesis.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <blockquote><dl><dt><em><strong>Extrapolate</strong></em></dt><dd><em>To infer an unknown from something that is known; conjecture.</em><span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><br />-- The Random House College Dictionary</span></dd></dl></blockquote>

<p><a href="mailto:mlasalle@sfchronicle.com">Mick LaSalle</a>, an acerbic movie reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, writes a regular column &quot;Ask Mick LaSalle&quot; in the Sunday paper, where he sometimes allows others to vent their displeasure at his movie reviews. In this week's <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/17/PKGJNCETV81.DTL">column</a> he says something that I find very accurate to my experience with the online medium:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As for why people get hostile when they hear a differing opinion, I go back to Spinoza's definition of love and hatred. He says that people love that which they think reinforces their survival and hate that which they think threatens their survival. I believe -- this is just my humble theory, now -- that when people hear an opinion that counters theirs, their minds extrapolate from that one opinion to imagine a whole philosophical system. And then they imagine how they would fare in a world run according to that imagined system. So they go from disagreeing to feeling threatened in a matter of seconds, and they lash out. Often they write letters that begin, &quot;You are obviously,&quot; and that's where they identify, not you, but the phantom they feel threatened by.</em></p>

<p><em>Over the years, I've been &quot;obviously&quot; liberal, conservative, gay, straight, humorless, frivolous, angry and deeply jealous of Tom Hanks. When I was 30, I remember getting accused of being a 45-year-old former hippie who drove a BMW, wore a Rolex and had done acid in the '60s. I'm not sure if I wrote back, but if I did, I would have said, &quot;Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.&quot; But, of course, that kind of letter is your key to acquiring distance. It lets you know that the person's real quarrel is with some middle-aged former hippie -- probably known as Dad -- and that you're just the vehicle for that day's projection.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I think that Mick LaSalle is exactly right -- I've seen this type of hostility based on extrapolation regularly in online mediums: in emails, newsgroups, wikis, blogs, etc. I've been guilty of it a few times myself, though usually for me the result is that I don't respond at all -- &quot;Oh, he is just a flaming liberal&quot;, &quot;She's an arch-conservative&quot; or &quot;He is a just a technophobe.&quot; I can then feel comfortable in ignoring the rest of his or her point of view rather then trying to understand it.</p>

<p>I doubt if explaining this theory to someone who writes a hostile message is useful -- they will take it as yet another attack, which will likely contribute to another cycle of flamage. But I do find Mick's theory useful as another way to read and understand hostile messages, and respond more appropriately.</p>

<p>Understanding this lets me add another widget to my social software toolbox: when a group process results in a hostile message, try to determine if the author is actually reacting to what you said or if their hostility is based on extrapolating to &quot;obvious&quot; generalities. This may not allow you to directly address the hostility, but it may help you better understand it and thus not contribute to the cycle of flames.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was reading on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> a discussion about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/10/0235212">iTune 4.8</a> and its new capability to purchase videos from the iTunes Music Store, when I read two things that just made me say &quot;duh&quot; with their obviousness, yet I'd never thought of them before.</p>

<p>Both of these &quot;duh&quot; moments were inspired by the comments by an anonymous Apple engineer with the handle <a href="http://slashdot.org/~As%20Seen%20On%20TV">As Seen on TV</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Everybody's wrong about the video iPod thing. A video iPod would be a dumb idea for lots of reasons, some technical, some psychological. If you want to know where we're going with video playback, look not to the iPod but to its considerably less famous little brother, AirPort Express.</em></p></blockquote><p>He didn't explain himself further, but I grokked it immediately. The current <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express</a> already offers digital output of audio in a feature called &quot;AirTunes&quot;. It isn't much of a stretch to believe that they could add the capability to offer video. If they added a dedicated H.264/MPEG4 decoder chip to the Airport Express, you could just plug in an HD-capable monitor and offer internet delivery of video and movies. The bandwidth wouldn't be an issue, as you are talking only 2 Mbps for the most popular HD compressed format, and even the full resolution 1080i compressed only requires 8-9 Mbps -- all of which will fit amply the bandwidth available to 802.11g. Thus &quot;AirVideo&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;As Seen on TV&quot; continues with more insights on Apple's strategy:</p><blockquote><p><em>And the iPod is not repeat not gonna say it one more time not meant to be a video-playback device. It’s not even remotely designed for it. The iPod has a tiny hard drive that’s designed for embedded applications, and a 32 MB (I think it is) RAM buffer cache that’s optimized for dealing with song-sized chunks of data. That’s about 4 MB. Even a half hour of HD content is gonna be half a gigabyte. There’s basically no way for the iPod to play that without constantly keeping the hard drive running, and that will burn out the drive very quickly. Seriously, under constant use, the iPod hard drives’ life spans are measured in tens of hours.</em></p>

<p><em>(How can we do photos, then? Easy. Photos are even smaller than songs. And unlike video, people often do want to carry photos around with them. Keep reading.)</em></p>

<p><em>Remember when I said the problem was part technology and part psychology? People like to listen to music while they do other things: Ride on the train, exercise, shop. People like to multi-task with their music.</em></p>

<p><em>Video, whether short-form like TV or long-form like movies, isn’t like that. Video is an immersive experience. You sit down and you watch it, and you don’t do anything else until it’s over. That’s a totally different interaction model than music.</em></p>

<p><em>So there’s basically zero reason for video to be portable. You’re not going to carry it around with you. You’re going to watch it at home.</em></p>

<p><em>Exceptions? Sure. But Apple isn’t a company that makes a habit of marketing to the exceptions. We shoot for a pretty clearly defined target market and let the exceptions buy their gadgets somewhere else. Chiefly because there aren’t nearly enough exceptions out there to make it worth going after, financially speaking. We’d never be able to recover what we invest in R&amp;D and design by selling a few hundred thousand units. We have to sell millions of units per quarter, otherwise the business plan just doesn’t work.</em></p></blockquote><p>This all made sense, but it this comment that brought it home: </p><blockquote><p><em>All you have to do is pay attention to the way people interact with their media. The difference between immersive media and ambient media jump out at you immediately.</em></p></blockquote><p>I'd guess never really understood intuitively the concept that there are really two major media types: ambient and immersive. Now that I understand it, it seems obvious. I just never internalized the difference. Yes, sometimes TV is an ambient media, sometimes music is immersive, but only rarely. As I think about it more it makes me wonder about other types of ambient vs immersive media, such as games.</p>

<p>I'll close with more last quote from &quot;As Seen on TV&quot;: </p><blockquote><p><em>I know you’re going to say I’m being a dick here, but I’m going to give you the pure, unvarnished truth: </em></p>

<p><em>Neither Apple’s management nor Apple’s shareholders give a shit about what the “alpha geeks” think. </em></p>

<p><em>I know, I know. It’s harsh. But it’s absolutely true. See, the “alpha geeks” are not our market. We don’t sell to them. The “alpha geeks” are defined by one key characteristic: they’re irrational. Now, I’m not trying to insult you. I mean it literally. Geeks are not rational. They base their purchasing decisions on things that, from a rational point of view, just don’t make any sense. Things like politics, lack “openness,” like “customizability.” Things that just don’t add up in the cost-benefit analysis. </em></p>

<p><em>That’s fine. That’s totally legitimate. But it’s not our business.</em></p>

<p><em>We sell products to people who want them to work. We don’t sell products to people who want to take them apart. There are other companies that do that. We don’t seek to dominate them or to put them out of business. We don’t see them as competition at all, because the kinds of people who buy our products would never buy a motherboard. They’d never buy Linux. Never in a million years. </em></p>

<p><em>Is there some overlap? Sure. We love the fact that some prominent hard-core geeks use Macs. But we’re not going to abandon our business plan to woo them. We’re not going to turn our backs on the vast and untapped market for next-generation content delivery services, a market which we basically created, in order to please some Internet message board guys. </em></p>

<p><em>Again, I’m sorry for sounding so harsh here. I don’t mean to be rude. I’m just not going to sugar-coat it for you. You do your thing, whatever makes you happy. We’ll do ours.</em></p></blockquote>

                                <p>If you read my blog through an aggregator, you may not have noticed my new sidebar &quot;Recent Bookmarks&quot;. It is a list of web pages that I've found interesting enough to annotate using the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> service. It is useful if you want to have an insight into what future blog entries I'm working on, as links will often show up there before my actual blog posting is out.</p>

<p>You alternatively can <a href="http://del.icio.us/ChristopherA?setcount=10">view my last 10 del.icio.us postings</a>, or subscribe to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/ChristopherA">del.icio.us RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in offering this feature in your own blog, I used the <a href="http://www.bigbold.com/rssdigest/">RSS Digest</a> webservice to create a javascript applet that formats information from my del.icio.us RSS feed into a format suitable for my sidebar. There are a lot of other cool things that are possible with this service.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I've been working on an ambitious list of topics that I'd like to cover over the next year. I offer them to you here so you can have some idea the areas that I am thinking about.</p>

<p><strong><em>Office Architecture for Innovation</em></strong> -- Over the years I've built or converted three offices to my specifications. From this I have learned a number of things about about how to create a productive environment innovation-oriented businesses. These include some of the obvious suggestions such as fresh air and natural light, but also include not so obvious ideas such as using magnetic paint and providing a small washer-dryer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Requisite Variety</em></strong> -- This concept from cybernetics applies to social systems as well. &quot;The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate.&quot; More people, as well as a diversity of thinking styles and experience, give social software more &quot;variety of actions&quot;, thus this is part of the reason why social software can be so effective.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Art and Craft of Meme Design</em></strong> -- We are learning more about how to create an effective meme. Creating memes has always been an art performed by publicists, marketers, politicians, the press, and to a lesser extent by scientists and other academics. Have we learned enough to turn this art into an explicit craft?</p>

<p><strong><em>Wiki Editing Dichotomy</em></strong> -- One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the &quot;wiki editing dichotomy&quot;. You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don't know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.</p>

<p><strong><em>Choice &amp; Neuroeconomics</em></strong> -- There are some that say at the root of every decision is emotion. Even a 'rational' decision appeals to a sense of balance or beauty. Recent studies using PET are establishing a neurological basis for emotions, and some reveal interesting facts about how we make choices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Assessing Risk</em></strong> -- There are a variety of areas where we as humans have a difficult time being completely rational. One of these is risk assessment. It turns out we may be hard-wired to not be able toeasily understand risk that is greater then one in a hundred or so. Thus a very rare risk, say one in a thousand, will often be emotionally interpreted as having a much higher risk.</p>


<p><strong><em>Persuasive Computing</em></strong> -- BJ Fogg's group at Stanford has done some interesting research on how computers can persuade you to do something. There are a number of useful ideas that come from this research. There are also some ethical considerations that should be discussed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cognitive Dissonance</em></strong> -- This technique is central to many forms of persuasion intended to change beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors. It is used by facilitators, businesses, military organizations, and even cults. It can be used positively or negatively. How might it be used in social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>The Dark Side of the Force</em></strong> -- The same social tools that we use for good, can also be used for harm. How do we ethically use what we are learning about social software? Some say that almost by definition social software attracts spammers, trolls, and innappropriate sexuality. What can we do to prevent these misuses of social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Conversation vs Communication</em></strong> -- Update and rewrite of my <a href="http://www.alacritymanagement.com/GCnC.html">1990 essay</a> on how social software design needs to balance conversation vs communication.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Emotions</em></strong> -- We appear to have evolved a number of emotions that appear primarily to exist to support a common good, rather then to ensure our individual success. These include schadenfreude, mirth, naches, revenge, shame, pride, outrage, approbation, admiration, elevation, etc. Studies by Eckman on unconscious facial gestures, studies on the neurological basis for emotions, and studies on emotions in games, are proving that these social emotions exist. A number of them have interesting implications on social software.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glances &amp; Strokes</em></strong> -- There is some old work on the amount of eye contact we make with others in small groups, as well as some research from transactional analysis on strokes, which are the amount of recognition given to others through words and deeds. Is there a neurological basis for needing a certain number of glances and strokes each day? How does this concept apply to social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Weak Links</em></strong> -- There are some interesting social implications behind what we've learned about weak links in social networks. How do we identify and encourage weak links in our social software systems?</p>

<p><strong><em>Negativity vs Positivity</em></strong> -- It is far easier for someone to respond negativel than positively. In political systems it is far easier to say no rather then yes. What social software encourages positivity, and is it possible to design social software to do so?</p>

<p><strong><em>Time Economy</em></strong> -- Our ultimate most unrenewable resource is time. How time and attention are a basic economic unit that should be considered when looking at social software.</p>


<p><strong><em>Group Life Cycle</em></strong> -- We often focus on how groups form, emerge, and grow. Yet there are many lessons to be learned from how groups die, including that it isn't necessarily a bad thing and that keeping a group from death can be dysfunctional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Groupthink</em></strong> -- What causes groupthink? When is it good and when is it bad?</p>


<p><strong><em>Two Thresholds in the Value of Knowledge</em></strong> -- In order for knowledge to be valuable, it must at minimum be more valuable then the costs to find and absorb it (costs which include bandwidth and attention). Tools like Google have tremendously increased the amount of knowledge that is worth the time and attention to find it. What types of knowledge fall below this threshold of value? Is there a limit to how much we can lower this line? Furthermore, there is another threshold where the knowledge is significantly more valuable than only bandwidth and attention. How much have internet tools impacted this second threshold? Many internet business models, in particular content models, require some ability to offer value in this upper threshold -- can they survive as this upper threshold changes?</p>

<p><strong><em>Intimacy and Social Networks</em></strong> -- Social Networks Analysis tends to focus on the connections between people, either explicitly through acknowledgement of connections (LinkedIn, Friendster) or implicitly through analysis of your communication (Spoke). None are able to measure intimacy. Yet our intimate social networks are an important component of our overall happiness and contentment within both our professional and personal lives. How does intimacy work in social networks? Also there are some concepts in psychology known as communal vs exchange relationships by Clark &amp; Mills from late 70's that may apply here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Games</em></strong> -- A recap of Shannon Appelcline's and my analysis of the basic forms of social games types. These include relatively well understood ones like majority control, voting, meta-voting (Nomic), auctioning, etc., but also include less well understood games like playing of roles, dominance and submission, etc. There are also links to social emotions, such as mirth and schadenfraude.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Castle Marrach</em></strong> -- We released the Castle Marrach online game in September of 2000, and it was designed from the beginning to be a game for the Bartle-type known as &quot;the socializer&quot;. What lessons did we learn in the five years since the release of the game? What tools are in my social software toolbox today that might have helped with the design?</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from F2F Facilitation</em></strong> -- There are many skilled practitioners of face-to-face facilitation, some of which are paid very high fees for their skills. What lessons can we learn from their experience that we can apply to social software? Why have so many of these facilitators failed to have success online?</p>

<p><strong><em>More Human vs More Than Human</em></strong> -- Many futurists seek to offer us augmentation of our minds and bodies through technology. Many of these ideas may fundamentally change what it is to be human, and may even have unforeseen complications unanticipated by their creators. One interesting approach to looking at these technologies is to examine which make us &quot;more human&quot;, rather then &quot;more than human&quot;.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Mental Disorders</em></strong> -- Most, if not all, mental disorders have their roots in survival strategies; however, they are over-expressed because of genetic or other causes. Examining the healthy behaviors hiding behind depression, autism, mania, schizophrenia, paranoia, etc. offer a number of insights on how we think.</p>

<p><strong><em>Joy of being a Primate</em></strong> -- If you scan the surface of my writing, you may observe that I have a strong belief that our animal nature and genetics form an essential and often unconscious part of what it is to be human. You could interpret these &quot;nature&quot; over &quot;nurture&quot; ideas as limiting us to being just animals. Instead, I believe that by becoming aware of our primate nature, and choosing to leverage it or suppress it by conscious choice rather then letting it drive us unaware, is what makes us more powerful.</p>

<p><strong><em>Smart Contracts</em></strong> -- Nick Szabo popularized the idea of using some of the primitives of cryptography in unique ways to create what he calls &quot;smart contracts&quot;. He hypothesized approaches to cryptographic handling of collateral, bonding, delineation of property, bearer certificates, and much more. Others have proposed various auction protocols using these concepts. One of the fundamental atomic elements of many of these smart contracts is something called a &quot;reusable proof of work&quot;, which Hal Finney recently demoed a version of at CodeCon 2005. What are the possibilities offered by smart contracts? What are the barriers to implementation?</p>

<p><strong><em>Club System</em></strong> -- In the 80's, development of Ted Nelson's Xanadu vision was being financed by Autodesk. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons Xanadu failed to deliver any technology. However, a couple of their ideas could be valuable today, one of which is the concept of an alternative to the &quot;user and groups&quot; metaphor for computer security. Xanadu turned that idea upside down and called the result the &quot;club system&quot;. The club system approach is particularly suited to the internet based collaboration tools, in particular wikis. I also have some insights to offer a cryptographic approach to the club system, which might allow P2P distribution of collaborative documents, while preserving group privileges.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edges of Cryptographic Security</em></strong> -- The SSL cryptographic protocol offers a choice of a number of security properties: integrity, confidentiality, encryption, one-party authentication, and two-party authentication. But there are a number of security properties that very few deployed cryptographic protocols offer. These include perfect forward secrecy, undeniability, deniability, authorization, delegation, multi-party authentication, shared secrets, etc. What are these security properties and how are they useful? Why have they not been successfully broadly deployed?</p>

<p><strong><em>The SSL Story</em></strong> -- When SSL was first proposed it was broken within an hour. Even when Netscape fixed those problems, it wasn't clear that SSL was going to win the battle of security protocols. SSL was competing against SHTTP which had backing of RSA and an industry consortium. The credit card companies merged their standards and were backing SET. The internet community was moving toward SSH. Microsoft was doing its own embrace and extend protocol PCT. So how did SSL win to become the broadest deployed cryptographic security protocol? The answers may surprise you.</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my post about the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> I offered some evidence on the levels of satisfaction of various group sizes based on some empirical data from online games. There I was able to show that even though the Dunbar Number might predict a mean group size of 150 for humans, that in fact for non-survival oriented groups the mean was significantly less, probably between 60 to 90.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/groupsatisfaction.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=436,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="400" height="272" border="0" alt="Groupsatisfaction" title="Groupsatisfaction" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/groupsatisfaction.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
I also offered a second hypothesis, that there is a dip in satisfaction level of groups at around the size of 15. Unfortunately, I could only offer anecdotal evidence that this threshold existed. My personal belief was that this dip was caused by not enough &quot;attention&quot; being given to everyone and that group gatherings of this size risk becoming too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Yet groups of this size are not large enough to allow for different perspectives (i.e. insufficient <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REQVAR.html">requisite variety</a>) or for other group processes to come into play.</p>

<p>I was reading through the current (12 March) issue of <em>New Scientist</em>, and found an interesting table in the article <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18524901.600">Charity Begins at Homo Sapiens</a>. It stood out to me as it showed a dip approaching zero average cooperation for group sizes of 16 -- almost precisely same place that my hypothesis predicted.</p>

<p>Digging further, I found the original source for this table was published in <em>Nature</em> back in October 2003, in <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/papers/NatureOfHumanAltruism.pdf">The Nature of Human Altruism</a> written by <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/">Ernst Fehr</a> and <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fischbacher/">Urs Fischbacher</a>.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=495,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif"><img width="400" height="309" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif" title="Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1" alt="Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: left;" /></a>What the chart shows is actually not empirical data from human experiments, but instead data from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a> simulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>. This is the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum">zero-sum game</a> where if you cooperate, the joint payoff of the players is higher. However, in zero-sum games there is also incentive for the players to cheat by defecting and thus taking less risk. Robert Axelrod showed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465021212/102-0974708-1794504">The Evolution of Cooperation</a> back in 1985 that in spite of the statistical best individual strategy being that of defection, cooperation inevitably evolves.</p>

<p>Fehr and Fischbacher, in their <em>Nature</em> article, took this idea a bit further by creating 100 independent simulations with group sizes ranging from 2 to 512, and then executing each simulation 1,000 to 2,000 times. Each generation of the &quot;players&quot; was allowed to evolve different strategies of cooperation vs defection, the classic successful strategy being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat">Tit for Tat</a>. They would then evaluate the percentage of players who had cooperative strategies.</p>

<p>If punishment of defections was ruled out, they discovered that over the 1,000+ generations of the simulation that the rate of cooperation quickly crashes, such that at the group size of 8 a little over 50% cooperation evolved, and for groups that are larger than 16 none cooperate.</p>

<p>Next they added to the simulation &quot;<a name="altruistic_punishment">Altruistic Punishment</a>&quot;. This is the ability for players to punish those who did not cooperate -- however, such punishment is at some cost to the punisher. Earlier game theory <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/get_doc.pl?urn=RePEc:wpa:wuwpmi:0305006&amp;url=http://econwpa.wustl.edu:8089/eps/mic/papers/0305/0305006.pdf">research on altruistic punishment</a> has shown that cooperation flourishes if there is some price for punishing defectors -- if you allow punishment at no cost then cheating strategies emerge. This earlier research determined that allowing individuals to punish at some cost that yields them no material gain will paradoxically result in an average gain for everyone.</p>

<p>Adding altruistic punishment to the simulation increased the amount of cooperation that evolved, such that groups with the size of 32 would have 50% cooperation. But even this had limits; at the group size of 128 no cooperation would evolve.</p>

<p>Finally, if they added to the simulation the ability to punish those who did not participate in punishing (i.e. didn't pay the cost to punish defectors), then the percentage of cooperation that evolved was never less then 60%, and in fact got better as groups got larger.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting result. To explain it in different terms, if you have a system that depends on sharing some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">commons</a> and there are no process or trust metrics, a group as small as 16 may find themselves not cooperating very effectively.</p>

<p>The idea of commons can be as simple as how much speaking time participants in a meeting share. The time that each participant uses during the meeting can be considered the shared &quot;commons&quot;. If there are no enforced rules, with a group size of 16 there will inevitably be someone who will abuse the time and speak more than their share.</p>

<p>With some simple rules (some type of process to partition time more fairly), or through some trust metrics (punish those who abuse the commons), larger groups can gain value from cooperating, but even these groups have limits. As long as there is some effort required to punish those who abuse the process, eventually the price for that effort becomes too high, and no one is willing to punish any longer. You see this in moderated discussion groups, where the guardians of the common good have to spend too much time moderating, given the number of people that wish to participate. Moderated newsgroups and early versions of SlashDot moderation had this problem.</p>

<p>The most interesting observation from this simulation is that for larger groups, you needed to have a system to punish those who did not participate in punishing -- or to put it another way, get everyone involved with the process, not just a few. I think that this explains something that I've always wondered about SlashDot's <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MetaModeration">meta-moderation</a> system -- with this feature you grade those who have moderated, and if someone abuses it they will no longer be able to moderate. What I suspect, given these results, is that if you don't participate in the meta-moderation system, you have less a chance of being able to moderate; thus SlashDot has a system that punishes those who are not involved in participating.</p>

<p>I do have some questions based on this simulation -- I would like to see results with more granularity then powers of 2. I'd also like to know the percentage of players participating in punishment -- I suspect that you'll find a very small number of &quot;moderators&quot; are required in the middle graph, even when cooperation evolves successfully. I'm curious as to how many moderators are required to participate in punishing the non-punishers for cooperation to evolve in the third scenario. Also, in meta-moderation this simulation emphasizes punishing the non-punishers -- is that as successful as rewarding the punishers? I'm also interested in investigating some of the further works where Fehr and Fischbacher are among the co-authors, such as this <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/science/Altruistic_Punishment.pdf">study</a> using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) that shows that our brain's pleasure systems are activated when we altruistically punish.</p>

<p>I'm sure that the findings of this simulation are not the only reason why there might be a dip in group satisfaction at group sizes around 15, such as I observed. However, it does offer some interesting insights into group size thresholds, both for the threshold at 15 and for threshold of non-survival groups which I've identified as being significantly less then the Dunbar mean of 150. It also shows that for large groups we need to offer not only moderation, but meta-moderation capabilities that involve all the participants in the process.</p>

<p>In summary this research offers me another widget for my social software toolbox: in any group process look for the commons, allow participants to participate in identifing defectors; determine what the costs are for such identification (which may be as simple as requiring some attention or charging for such punishment); and encourage participation in the common good by punishing those who do not participate in seeking out defectors.</p>

several years a sometimes weekly, sometimes bi-weekly column on the
topic of game design called <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_.shtml">Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> (rss feed for all <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/index.xml">Skotos Articles</a> including TT&amp;T).</p>

<p>His latest column <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_163.phtml">Social Software &amp; Gaming: User Content</a> discusses issues of user content and user facilitation that apply both online game communities and social software:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>...the more user content that we allow into games, the more
troubles we have separating the good from the bad, the signal from the
noise. As we introduce user content systems into games, filtering it will become the next challenge. Fortunately there are already some answers in our nearby field of Social Software.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>As I wrote about in an <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/socialization_i.html">older post</a>, Shannon has also written a number of interesting columns on the topic of designing social games:</p>

                                <p>I'm a keynote speaker for the <a href="http://www.nvhainnovations.org/2005/index.htm">FVHA (Future of Voluntary Health Associations) Conference</a>
in Atlanta today. My job is to give to this community a gentle
introduction and overview of concepts and products related to Social
Software and Social Networking. (<a href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/FVHA_Social_Software_Keynote_Presentation.pdf">My slides are here - 6.6MB .pdf</a>)</p>

<p>

In my research about this community, I find that they have some unique and interesting problems.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acsrelay.jpg" title="Acsrelay" alt="Acsrelay" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />

The attendees of this conference are a collection of VPs and national
directors from major Voluntary Health Associations such as American
Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, March of
Dimes, etc. In turn, these Voluntary Health Associations organize
communities in order to raise funds for, and inform the public about
the medical implications for the different health problems that each are
concerned with. These associations have an organized volunteer base of
over five million people and raise in excess of two billion dollars
annually. They all have dedicated and diverse volunteer communities
which include practicing MDs, scientific researchers, health educators,
business executives, and working and nonworking mothers.</p>

<p>

I think it is the quantity of people served, the diversity of their
communities, and in particular, the need to dive deep into information
that makes these Voluntary Health Associations interesting. A women diagnosed
with breast cancer will need to make educated decisions about her own
health care in order to give informed consent. Yet she may not have the
education experience or background to understand the care decisions she
must make. She may not even have a current era computer. There are
few other online communities that need their members to understand so
deeply such difficult problems.</p>

<p>
Thus the desire of these associations to look deeper in to Social
Software. Of course, their key interest is in better understanding,
motivating, and expanding their volunteer networks. They are already
experts in the business of organizing traditional communities, but now
they have to deal with the changing nature of communities as their
members are now using the internet as the primary source of
information.</p>

<p>

Ideally Social Software can help increase their sense of touch with
their volunteers, it can empower volunteers to collaborate and work
harder and in new ways, it can increase information sharing and
innovation, and it can help drive fund-raising numbers higher.</p>

<p>But the
openness of social software comes with a price. For instance, many of
these associations are afraid of enabling even simple unmoderated
discussion lists, in fear that bad or inappropriate information would be shared. There are also legitimate concerns about the quality, audience level, and attributation for even correct information. In the Q&amp;A after my presentation I tried to explain how, when looking at individual blogs, or individual events of info vandalism, it is not really relevant if the communities and processes behind the Social Software are able to correct or filter those events. This is a difficult point to get across, as it requires people to learn to trust a system where the squeaky wheels and trolls are the loudest.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acslogowhite.gif" title="Acslogowhite" alt="Acslogowhite" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />

One particular interesting thing about this conference is that
it is one of the first between multiple associations. I know from some
other non-profits that I'm working with that they often feel in
competition for funds and resources from other non-profits, so I
applaud the American Cancer Society for sponsoring this cross-pollination effort.</p>

<p>As someone who now has over 171 professional &quot;connections&quot; in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn Profile</a>, 198 &quot;friends&quot; on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a>, many more non-intersecting friends and acquaintances on&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.Net</a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/christophera_/">LiveJournal</a>, and <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/sns-meta-list/">other social networking services</a>, as well as a plethora of correspondents that I only interact with via email, I am trying reconcile a mismatch between my connections and my own <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?</p>

<p>Venture Capitalist <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/02/quality_or_quan.html">Jeff Nolan</a> relates similar concerns:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
&quot;It strikes me that the social networking theory holds that the more volume you have, the bigger your network will become by introducing degrees of separation roughly along the lines of Metcalfe's Law. I disagree, human networks do not grow in value by multiplying, but rather by reduction. For me, it's the quality of relationships that enhances my professional and personal life, not the sheer numbers.&quot;
</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately social networking services -- be it LinkedIn, Tribe.Net, Orkut, or LiveJournal -- are making the problem worse, not solving it. Any engineer or information theorist can tell you that a system that only has amplifiers will be out of balance, and that you need attenuators in the system as well. Our current breed of social networking services have focused on amplifying our contacts not only because it serves us, but because it serves them. The more contacts that you make, the more people they potentially have in their service. However, in the long run this is unsustainable -- a social networking service also has to be useful -- merely amplifying your contacts isn't enough.</p>

<p>Thus the problem becomes not just one unique to me, where my friends network is overextended, but rather one that's endemic to the current generation of social networking services. In order to solve it we need to look at the traditional cultural answers to the problem, compare them to technical solutions, both current and to-be-invented, and then see how a new generation of social networking services can be designed that molds the two ideas together into a more cohesive whole.</p>

<p>I offer here the beginning of that discussion.</p>

<h4>The Cultural Strategies</h4>

<p>The problem of overextended social networks are not new with the Internet generation. Many professions require maintaining a large base of relationships and have done so for hundreds of years, among them: politicians, salespeople, public company CEOs, and even professions that you might not think of requiring these skills such as family doctors. The Dunbar Number of 150 may be a kind of species-wide average limit, it is not an individual limit -- thus my guess is that people with an innate talent for maintaining more relationships are attracted to these professions. But even with innate talent those who follow these professions can be overwhelmed, and each have found different cultural strategies for managing larger numbers of relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Spending More Time:</strong> Some people just spend a lot more time keeping up with their connections. Politicians and salespeople are classic examples of professions that require significant schmoozing time in order to keep trusted connections together.</p>

<p>How does someone like a member of the US House of Representatives manage their relationships? In no way can they even come close to having a relationship with all the 645,952 people they represent. They would, however, at least have to keep up at some level with the other 435 House members, their own staff, key members of the staff of other House members, as well as key politicians and contacts back home. From what I've read, successful politicians spend most of their days just meeting with people, and have staff dedicated to &quot;tickling&quot; -- keeping track of constituents, schedules, issues, etc. and reminding the politician before each meeting of the essentials they need to know.</p>

<p>The cost of this strategy is twofold -- the time spent managing relationships can't be spent elsewhere, and the quantity of relationships lowers the quality of those relationships. For instance, my experience with most politicians and many salesperson is that I will be forgotten as soon as I leave the room.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Changing the Standard:</strong> There are different cultural standards in each profession as to what is an acceptable relationship. Thus some people chooose a profession that manages relationships in different ways. Doctors are a good example of socializers who fit into this category.</p>

<p>Your family doctor has a similar problem to that of politicians -- too many people to keep track of. Yet a good family practitioner can see you and look beyond just today's symptoms. Thus because of an ongoing relationship with you he can be a better doctor.</p>

<p>The way the doctor does this is through cultural and professional limits. Because of the authority, status and title granted to doctors, patients tend to defer to them. There is not an expectation that the relationship is equal. This allows the doctor to have a 'shallower' relationship with the patient that is still acceptable.</p>

<p>Still, even this level of serial, shallow socialization can be excessive for many people. A Radiologist acquaintance of mine told me the reason why she ended up in her specialty was that she just couldn't handle the ongoing patient relationships required by other specialities -- instead, she now looks at one set of images at a time, performs a diagnosis, and doesn't have to retain any relationship to move on to the next patient.</p>

<p>There are also problems with changing your socialization standards. Unless it is culturally understood, or your standard is reciprocated by others, it can make you appear shallow and not trustworthy. I've seen this when someone moves from one profession to another, say a salesperson to a manager -- styles of relationships that were acceptable among salesperson and between salespeople and customers are not quite as acceptable as those between managers and their staff. Another example is when someone moves from the East Coast to the West Coast, where the usefulness of casual alumni connections is significantly less valued, but those casual connections are unable to understand the change in standards.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Prioritization:</strong> Perhaps a more common cultural strategy for managing excessive relationships is prioritization. I could prioritize my relationships and focus only on the 100+ or so that might be the most useful to me.</p>

<p>There are two problems with prioritizing. First, analyses of social networks show that it is often the weak and most unrelated links that can be <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1333462/0">the most important</a>. Thus any attempt to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage">triage</a> may cut off some of these weak ties because I thought that the links might not be &quot;useful&quot;.</p>

<p>Secondly, how do you tell someone &quot;I'm sorry, but I'm overly Dunbarred, so I have removed you from my list.&quot; Rejection is painful (as <a href="http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/mripain01.htm">MRI brain studies</a> have actually shown), so I risk offending people forever by excluding them today.</p>

<h4>The Technological Solutions</h4>

<p>One of the great hopes of social networking services is to improve the ways that we interact with other people, particularly those that we know at a distance -- the &quot;weak links&quot;. Right now, these services are part of the problem because they offer out-of-balance social systems. However, they can also be part of the solution; science-fiction writers and social software designers alike are starting to look at these issues and offer new solutions that would not have been possible before the advent of widespread software communication systems.</p>

<p><strong>Technological Solution - Augmentation:</strong> <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/geodesica.jpg" title="Geodesica" alt="Geodesica" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />I recently read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a>, a new science fiction novel by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, a futurist example of augmentation as a method of maintaining extended social networks.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a> the protagonist, &quot;Melilah&quot; is a politician in the distant future. She has her own problems with the Dunbar Number, and solves it with her own personalized social networking service:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Two things she had learned from her political career were that society depended on interpersonal relationship networks, and that everything could turn on a simple misidentification. In her fifties she had set about ensuring that her memory remained in good working order in order to avoid the latter. Anthropologists had known since the twentieth century that people were born with a ceiling on their social groups. Once Melilah exceeded the Dunbar and Hill number of 150, and rapidly acquiring still more associates, it became progressively harder to keep track of everyone she had to know. As she passed her hundredth birthday, it became only worse. Some of her contemporaries option for cortical grafts and other memory prosthetics. She, motivated by a gut-level -- some would say irrational -- desire to keep her body as free of technology as possible, opted for other means.</em></p>

<p><em>She had found that using a name once every two months was enough to keep her memory fresh. Any longer than that between reminders, and the associations faded, rendering recall unreliable. So she programmed a complete list of her occasional acquaintances and enemies into a database and programmed it to cycle through them ever sixty days, shuffling the order each time.</em></p>

<p><em>A hundred years on, she was still in the habit of skimming fifty or so names a day, just to keep on the ball. By flicking through the images, voice files, place names, and more obtuse clues, she felt confident of recognizing any of the several thousand people more or less likely to interact with her at any point in the near future. The list had grown and shrunk down over the years, and many people had dropped off it entirely because of death or distance. Sometimes she added names to the list only to be surprised that they had been on it once before, decades ago, and she had forgotten them completely. That only reinforced the need for the list and the effort to keep it fresh in her mind.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure that the Dunbar Number problem is solely one of &quot;recognition&quot;, as illustrated by Williams and Dix. However, I think this is a great example of seeing how a traditional cultural solution to network overextension (namely, &quot;Spending More Time&quot;) can be better applied by Social Software. In this example Melilah's software automates the &quot;ticklers&quot; that politicians use.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/spokekeepintouchsettings.gif" title="Spokekeepintouchsettings" alt="Spokekeepintouchsettings" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: right;" />Already at least one social networking service has adopted a somewhat similar idea.
<a href="http://center.spoke.com/person/personalProfileTab.spoke?id=[serverID=center,ID=4877427]">Spoke</a> has a &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; setting. The Spoke client software will watch your Outlook mailbox and addressbook to see how often you contact various people, and if you don't email them or modify your address book entry for them periodically, will remind you that you should contact them.</p>

<p>I've never used Spoke's &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; feature -- largely for privacy reasons (I was <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html">stung by a Zero Degrees</a> Outlook extension), but also because Spoke seemed to be oriented toward salespeople and thus emphasized growing the network. My problem is not growing my network, but managing the network I already have more effectively. But I may have to take another look at Spoke. So, it doesn't quite offer the same solution that Melilah used in the far-future, but it's still a start upon that path.</p>

<h4>Conclusions and Questions</h4>

<p>I'm not certain that Spoke's &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; feature, or Melilah's social recognition reminder service are the full solution to the &quot;Dunbar Triage&quot; problem. However, they do at least offer a few examples of people looking at the problems, and how social software can help solve them.</p>

<p>As I've outlined here there are at least three traditional methods&nbsp; that we've used to manage Dunbar Triage prior to advent of social networking services: spending more time, changing standards, and prioritization. The technological solutions that I've offered up as an example concentrates upon the first of those cultural solutions, but it is by no means a conclusive statement on the issue.</p>

<p>How could next-generation social networking services improve upon the ideas of changing standards or prioritization? Could simple categorization help improve expectations for attention levels that various associates receive from you? Are there ways that social networking services, acting as an intermediary, could better manage disappointment-inducing events, such as a decision to spend less attention on an associate?</p>

<p>More so, could social software offer solutions that aren't even being considered right now? For example, many Cyberpunk novels have suggested the ideas of avatars that can collect information for you on the 'net while your attention is elsewhere. Could these avatars likewise maintain more distant social networks for you, without your full attention? Would that function even be desirable?</p>

<p>Some solutions are not technological -- what new skills and changes to practices, etiquette and ethics are required for our ever expanding network of relationships? Or as <a href="http://alevin.com/weblog/">Adina</a> asks: <em>&quot;Who will offer us a 21st century, internet-augmented take on Dale Carnegie and Emily Post?&quot;</em></p>

<p>As with any problem in the developing technical world, the first step is to define the problem and to consider possible solutions. Here's the start: social networks can become too large, and many social networking services are causing the problem rather than solving it.</p>

<p>What's your solution?</p>
