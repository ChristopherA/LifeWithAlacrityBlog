			<blockquote><dl><dt><em><strong>Extrapolate</strong></em></dt><dd><em>To infer an unknown from something that is known; conjecture.</em><span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><br />-- The Random House College Dictionary</span></dd></dl></blockquote>

<p><a href="mailto:mlasalle@sfchronicle.com">Mick LaSalle</a>, an acerbic movie reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, writes a regular column &quot;Ask Mick LaSalle&quot; in the Sunday paper, where he sometimes allows others to vent their displeasure at his movie reviews. In this week's <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/17/PKGJNCETV81.DTL">column</a> he says something that I find very accurate to my experience with the online medium:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As for why people get hostile when they hear a differing opinion, I go back to Spinoza's definition of love and hatred. He says that people love that which they think reinforces their survival and hate that which they think threatens their survival. I believe -- this is just my humble theory, now -- that when people hear an opinion that counters theirs, their minds extrapolate from that one opinion to imagine a whole philosophical system. And then they imagine how they would fare in a world run according to that imagined system. So they go from disagreeing to feeling threatened in a matter of seconds, and they lash out. Often they write letters that begin, &quot;You are obviously,&quot; and that's where they identify, not you, but the phantom they feel threatened by.</em></p>

<p><em>Over the years, I've been &quot;obviously&quot; liberal, conservative, gay, straight, humorless, frivolous, angry and deeply jealous of Tom Hanks. When I was 30, I remember getting accused of being a 45-year-old former hippie who drove a BMW, wore a Rolex and had done acid in the '60s. I'm not sure if I wrote back, but if I did, I would have said, &quot;Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.&quot; But, of course, that kind of letter is your key to acquiring distance. It lets you know that the person's real quarrel is with some middle-aged former hippie -- probably known as Dad -- and that you're just the vehicle for that day's projection.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I think that Mick LaSalle is exactly right -- I've seen this type of hostility based on extrapolation regularly in online mediums: in emails, newsgroups, wikis, blogs, etc. I've been guilty of it a few times myself, though usually for me the result is that I don't respond at all -- &quot;Oh, he is just a flaming liberal&quot;, &quot;She's an arch-conservative&quot; or &quot;He is a just a technophobe.&quot; I can then feel comfortable in ignoring the rest of his or her point of view rather then trying to understand it.</p>

<p>I doubt if explaining this theory to someone who writes a hostile message is useful -- they will take it as yet another attack, which will likely contribute to another cycle of flamage. But I do find Mick's theory useful as another way to read and understand hostile messages, and respond more appropriately.</p>

<p>Understanding this lets me add another widget to my social software toolbox: when a group process results in a hostile message, try to determine if the author is actually reacting to what you said or if their hostility is based on extrapolating to &quot;obvious&quot; generalities. This may not allow you to directly address the hostility, but it may help you better understand it and thus not contribute to the cycle of flames.</p>

<p>I find that too much self-consciousness, self-thought reinforces a distorted, subjective view of reality. The solution is true involvement with the external world, through attempted REAL intimacy with the people and world around us. I do think impersonal means of communication like writing and reading function to distance, which could reinforce this same subjectivity.</p></span>

		<span id="comment-7487664-content"><p>Chris, we see a lot of this sort of thing in the Indian online world - at social networks, at blogs and forums.  Its probably got a lot to do with how we are coping with this relatively new medium.  I come from a society that&#39;s so hierarchical in nature, that has very strong rules and sets of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts, that has power balances rooted in tradition, that has little concept or value for personal space, and that doesnot always encourage team play.   </p>

<p>The online world is toppling and threatening many of our traditional structures, giving open voice and power to many who hitherto had none.  It&#39;s a world that is not hierarchical, one that encourages an even-playing field for free speech and debate no matter what gender or age or race or religion you belong to, it does not have many pre-ordained rules and prescriptions, it is one where we need to learn to respect personal space, and where team play can be so rewarding. </p>

<p>Maybe we&#39;re in a state of Anomie as we transition - we&#39;re all learning ... the way i deal with it is to simply ignore obvious &#39;flamers&#39;, and not engage in a debate.  When you don&#39;t engage someone, they may knock harder for a while, but soon, they will go away.  Maybe the system self-corrects too?</p></span>

		<span id="comment-7623699-content"><p>Hey, Chris, your post reminded me of the concept of &quot;egocasting&quot; which I blogged about earlier this year.  </p>

<p>&quot;egocasting: the act of using your ability to personalize and filter intermediated experience to make your world match who you already are&quot;</p>

<p>As our technology continues to get better at helping us filter the world to fit our preferences, does our ability to understand and tolerate difference atrophy?</p>

<p>Are there ways to teach and encourage appreciation of difference through design of technology?  Or expand online messages to increase comprehension?</p>

<p>I agree with the comment above that this part of the nature of our subjective experience.  We all face the challenge of understanding each other regardless of the communication medium.</p></span>

<p>I got to your blog from an endorsement on your LinkedIn profile. Thank you for sharing this wonderful piece from Mick LaSalle. I blogged about it too on my business networking blog.</p>

<p>I also noticed that in your list of Social Networks on the sidebar, you haven&#39;t mentioned openBC - http://www.openbc.com , which is one of my two favorites for online networking [ the other being LinkedIn ].</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br />
